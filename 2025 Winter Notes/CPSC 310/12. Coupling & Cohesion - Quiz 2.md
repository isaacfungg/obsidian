#### Abstraction
Definition: Process of hiding complex details and only exposing only the essential features
* Mange complexity by focusing on key tasks for given task and stakeholder
* Both too much and too little abstraction inhibit understanding
#### Decomposition
* Mechanism for breaking down complex description into more manageable pieces
* Can be done both top down or bottom up
#### Information Hiding
* Hides implementation details from high level interfaces
* Autotest can only access your implementation through methods defined in the interface
#### Encapsulation
* Practice of hiding an object's internal data
* Mechanism for implementing abstraction
#### Coupling
* The relationship between models
* If we make a change to one module will it affect the other modules in the system
	* Modules should not depend on other modules
#### Cohesion
* The relationship between elements within a module
* Modules should only contain functions that belong together

###### Types of Cohesion
**Coincidental**: Unrelated tasks grouped arbitrarily 
**Logical**: Tasks grouped by similar type
**Temporal**: Tasks executed at the same time
**Procedural**: Tasks that follow a sequence of steps
**Communicational**: Tasks using the same data
**Sequential**: Output of one is input to another
**Functional**: All parts work together for one clear purpose
