***
**Observability**
* The extent to which the response of the CUT to a test can be verified
* Do we know enough to identify pass/fail?
**Controllability**
* The extent to which the CUT can be made to perform specific actions of interest
**Automatability**
* The ability to execute the test programmatically
**Isolateability**
* The degree to which the element under test can be validated on its own

###### 6 Dimension of Risks
**User**: Resistance to change; conflicts between them; negative attitudes towards the project; lack of commitment; lack of cooperation
**Requirements**: Changing; inadequately identified; unclear; incorrect
**Project Complexity**: New technology; high complexity; immature technology; first use of technology
**Planning & Control**: Poor process; inadequate estimation; poor planning; unclear milestones; inexperienced PM's; ineffective communication
**Team**: Lack of experience; lack of training; lack of specialized skills; lack of experience working as a team
**Organizational Environment**: Change of management during the project; unstable organization; ongoing restructuring

###### INVEST
**Independent**
* User stories should be independent of one another, but obviously they're not implemented in a vacuum
* Does not mean unsequenced
* Do need to build on one another but not depend on each other
**Negotiable**
* Clients have to be able to fully understand and critique how a feature will work
* Client friendly language and include time estimates
**Valuable**
* Best if it is providing value to a customer
**Estimatable**
* User story should be written precisely enough that a developer can estimate how long it will take
**Small**
* Small enough to fit within the work span of a couple of weeks
**Testable**
* Need to know how to test, what to test, and what it means when all those tests pass

###### Broken Code
**Its job**
* Execute according to its purpose without bugs
**Afford Change**
* Designed to accommodate change without rewriting
**Be understandable**
* For other developers and future you
