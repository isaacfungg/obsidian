**User Stories**
* Role - goal - benefit
* Definition of done: How the story can be validated by both the developer and the owner
* Engineering notes: Often used to capture key interactions of the feature with other parts of the system
* Effort estimate: Fibonacci sequence is often used when assigning a point value

**INVEST**
* Independent
	* Stories need to be independent
* Negotiable
	* Open to discussion
* Valuable
	* Value to the user or customer
* Estimatable
	* Small and clear enough to estimate effort
* Small
	* Can be completed in one sprint
* Testable
	* Has clear acceptance criteria

#### Black Box Testing
**Boundary Value Analysis**
* Includes inputs inside and outside the boundary
**Equivalence Class Partitioning**
* Technique that splits inputs or outputs into valid and invalid classes.
**Input Partitioning**
* Group input ranges that should produce the same output.
**Output Partitioning**
* Group outputs that represent the same behavior or result.
#### Static Analysis
**Static analyses**: Only inputs the program text itself and does not need to execute
* Formatting + Linting
**Dynamic analyses**? Needs to run the program
**Syntax**: Defines the set of valid tokens
**Semantics**: Define what the tokens actually mean
