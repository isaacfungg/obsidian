##### INVEST
**Independent**
* User stories should be independent of each other
* User stories do need to build on one another but should not depend on another
**Negotiable**
* Clients are able to fully understand the stories
* Include time estimates so that the customer can decide if a particular story is worth it
**Valuable**
* Provides value to the user
* Forces you to think in the client's perspective
**Estimatable**
* Should be written precisely enough where the developer can estimate how long it takes to finish it
**Small**
* Decreases risk, easier to find issues
**Testable**
* To know when you're done the story has to be testable

##### Comment Severity
**Nit**: This is a minor thing. Technically you should do it, but it won’t hugely impact things.
**Optional** (or Consider): I think this may be a good idea, but it’s not strictly required. 
**FYI**: I don’t expect you to do this in this CL, but you may find this interesting to think about for the future.
