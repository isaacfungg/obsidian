***
**Waterfall**
* The instructions between each step is very clear
* They do not go back after finishing a step
	* This makes it hard to make changes 

**Spiral Model**
* Enables much greater sensitivity to changes to requirements than waterfall
* Focuses More on risk management
* Overhead in risk management and review can be overwhelming and duration between spirals results in large delays between customer feedback

Phases
- **Planning**: Gathering and analyzing requirements.
- **Risk analysis**: Identify sources of risk and mitigation strategies.
- **Engineering**: The system is built and validated.
- **Evaluation**: System is validated externally with customers to inform future iterations.

**XP**


Key Principles
- **Communication**: Enabling open and continual communication between all stakeholders can help projects stay on track and make sure that all stakeholders are aware of the schedule impact various alternative decisions could have.
- **Simplicity**: By focusing on the simplest possible solution, engineers are able to validate their work with customers before tackling more expensive or challenging solutions.
- **Feedback**: Software is not developed in a vacuum, by combining feedback from tests, customers, and the team, more knowledge can be applied to ensure the most locally ‘correct’ decisions are being made.
- **Courage**: Be willing to discard failed experiments. An experiment is not a sunk-cost, but rather an opportunity to learn and improve the overall system.
- **Respect**: The focus on a system always being executable means that committing changes that ‘break the build’ is unacceptable as it slows down your teammates and hurts velocity. Respect also means focusing on the long-term understandability of your code by respecting the time a future developer would have to invest in understanding how your code works.
