#### Terms
**Cruft**: Design choices that impede change
**Technical Debt**: The extra time it takes to add new features to our system
**Code Smell**: A cosmetic issue you can see
#### Broken Code
- **Do its job** – The code must correctly perform its intended function without crashing or producing wrong results.
- **Afford change** – The code should be easy to modify, extend, or fix without causing new bugs; rigid or tangled code breaks this.
- **Be understandable** – The code must be readable and clear enough that others (or your future self) can comprehend and maintain it; unreadable code is effectively broken even if it runs.

#### Technical Debt
* If technical debt is not managed it builds up (like interest)
* Often from design choices that were made in the interest of time and budget
* Technical budget needs to be allocated on a different "budget"

#### Timeline
* If you identify a code smell then you should fix it before/after adding a feature

 #### Refactoring
 **How to refactor**:
* Make sure all your tests pass
* Examine the code smell
* Determine how to refactor the code
* Apply the refactoring
* Run the tests to make sure you did not break anything
* Repeat until the smell is gone

 **Do not refactor when**:
 * When the tests are failing
 * When you should just rewrite the code
 * When you have impending deadlines
