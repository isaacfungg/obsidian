#### Agile
Emergent design: Start at the Minimum Viable Product, then grow from there, identifying duplication and introducing abstractions as needed so solve duplication. 

Refactor code: rather than doing big design first (make pragmatic choices along the way -- this is not a license to write terrible code).
