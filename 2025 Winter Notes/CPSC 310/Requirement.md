Software should be user first
How software is currently and may be used in the future

**Main Four Properties**
* Complete
	* A spec that does not completely describe the requirement provides opportunities for misunderstanding between stakeholders
* Consistent
	* Conflicting requirements also generate misunderstandings
* Precise
	* The fact that specs cannot be automatically validates, means imprecise language can. further complicate understanding intended behaviour
* Concise
	* Having more also provided more space for imprecision and inconsistency

**Requirement Elicitation Process**
* Design constraints:
	* Can include regulatory compliance, budget, languages and frameworks, and development/security process requirements
* Environmental Constraints:
	* Ensure compatibility with existing systems and environments
* Preferences:
	* Not mandatory, but guide design tradeoffs
