#### Single Responsibility Principle
A class should have only a single responsibility
#### Open/Closed Principle
Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification
If your code is making changes based on internal flags or instanceof you are likely violating this principle
#### Liskov Substitution Principle
Should not break rules set by their superclass
For a class to be substitutable for its supertype, all the supertype black box tests must past when run on an instance of the subtype

**Precondition Rule**
* A subclass can't demand more than the superclass
**Postcondition Rule**
* A subclass must guarantee at least what the superclass promised
#### Interface Segregation Principle
No client should be forced to depend on methods it doesn't use
#### Dependency Inversion Principle
