#### Conceptual Design
**External Level (view)**: Describes different parts of the database to different users
**Conceptual Level (logical):** How data is perceived by the users

**IsA**
Partial: Some superclass entity may not be in any class
Total: A superclass entity must belong to some class
Disjoint: A superclass entity belongs to no more than a single class
Overlapping: Classes may overlap (can be both)

**Weak Entity**
Must have total participation in this identifying relationship

**Aggregation**
Allows us to treat a relationship set as an entity set for purposes of participation in other relationships
