**External Level (view)**: Describes different parts of the database to different users
**Conceptual Level (logical):** How data is perceived by the users

**IsA**
Partial: Some superclass entity may not be in any class

Disjoint: A superclass entity belongs to no more than a single class
Overlapping: Classes may overlap (can be both)
