***
- **Physical schema**: Describes _how data is actually stored_ on hardware (files, indexes, partitions).
- **Logical schema**: Describes the _structure of the data_ (tables, relationships, constraints) independent of physical storage.
* **Physical Data Independence**: Ability to modify physical schema without changing logical schema
* **Logical Data Independence**: Ability to change the conceptual schema without changing applications
* **Integrity Constraints**: Condition that must be true for any instance of the database
#### Relational Model
**Relational Database**: A set of relations
**Relation**: Made up of 2 parts
* **Schema**: Specifies name of relation, plus name and domain of each attribute
* **Instance**: A table with rows and columns
	* **Rows** = cardinality
	* **Columns** = arity/degree
**Relational Database Schema**: Collection of schemas in the database
**Database Instance**: A collection of instances of its relations
