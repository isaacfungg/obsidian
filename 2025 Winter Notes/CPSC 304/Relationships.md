`Relationships`:
* There can only be one value for each attribute on a relationship's attribute
	* If you want multiple values then you would have to move the relationship's attribute into an entity and give that entity the same attribute
`Aggregation`:
* Allows us to treat a relationship set as an entity set for purposes of participation in other relationships
