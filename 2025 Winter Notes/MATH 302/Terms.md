#### Section 1.1
`Sample Point`: Possible Outcome, usually denoted $\omega$
`Sample Space`: The set of all sample points denoted $\Omega$
* #$\Omega$ = cardinality of $\Omega$
`Event`: Subset of $\Omega$
`Power Set (F)`: All subsets of $\Omega$
* #$F = 2^{\# \Omega}$
`Pairwise Disjoint`: No two sets in the collection overlap
`Probability Space`: ($\Omega, F, P$)

#### Section 1.3
`Countably Infinite`: The set is infinite but you can list its elements in a sequence 
`Uncountably Infinite`: The set is infinite and too large to be listed in a sequence
`Discrete Sample Space`: Set of possible outcomes is finite or countably infinite

#### Section 1.4
`Complement`: $A^c$ = {Everything not in A}

#### Section 1.5
`Random Variable`: A function that assigns a numerical value to each outcome in the sample space
`Probability Distribution`: How probabilities are assigned to the values of a random variable
