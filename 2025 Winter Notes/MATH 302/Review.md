Random Variable (r.v.) is a function from omega to real number
Probability distribution of a a random variable x is the collection of probabilities
Discrete r.v. they take at most a countably infinite number of values

Probability mass function: Collection of probabilities p(k) = P(x = k) for all values k that x may take
