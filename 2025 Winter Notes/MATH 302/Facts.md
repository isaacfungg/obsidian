#### Section 1.2
* There are n! ways of ordering a list of n distinct elements
* If $\# \Omega \lt \infty$ and each outcome is equally likely, then $P(A) = \frac{\# A}{\# \Omega}$
* The number of ways to pick k items from n, where order matters, is $(n)_k = \frac{a!}{(n-k)!}$ called "n pick k"
* The number of ways of choosing k elements out of n, disregarding order, is $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$
