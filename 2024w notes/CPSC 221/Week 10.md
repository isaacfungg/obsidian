***
For a perfect tree of height $h$ containing $n = 2^{h+1} -1$ nodes, an efficient implementation of **BuildHeap** will call: `HeapifyDown at most n/2 times`

What is the worst case running time of **heapifyDown**/**heapifyUp
* $O(logn)$

What is the worst case running time of insert on a heap?
* $O(logn)$

What is the worst case running tie of the best algorithm to build a heap from an array containing $n$ items?
* $O(n)$

Consider a **minHeap** implemented as a zero-based array. Given an element at position $i$. what would be the position of its right child?
* $2i + 2$

Consider a **minHeap** implemented as a zero-based array. Given an element at position $i$. what would be the position of its left child?
* $2i + 1$
