***
`Complete Graph`: Maximum number of edges
`Connected Graph`: Path exists between every pair of vertices
`Connected Component`: Maximal connected subgraph
`Acyclic Graph`: No cycles
`Weighted Graph`: Each edge is assigned a weight


#### Connectivity
`Undirected graphs`: Connected if there is a path between any two vertices
`Directed graphs`: Strongly connected if there is a directed path from any vertex to any other
`Digraphs`: Weakly connected if there is a path between any two vertices, ignoring direction
`Complete graph`: Has an edge between every pair of vertices

#### Graph Density
`Sparse graph`: Has $O(|V|)$ edges
`Dense graph`: Has $\theta(|V^2|)$
