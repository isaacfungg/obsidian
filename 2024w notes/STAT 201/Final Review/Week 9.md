#### Learning Objectives
1. Describe the t-distribution family and its relationship with the normal distribution
2. Use results from the assumption of normality or the Central Limit Theorem to perform estimation and hypothesis testing
3. Compare and contrast the parts of estimation and hypothesis testing that differ between simulation and resampling-based approaches with the assumption of normality or the Central Limit Theorem-based approaches
4. Write a computer script to perform hypothesis testing based on results from the assumption of normality or the Central Limit Theorem
5. Discuss the potential limitations of these methods

### Z score
$Z = (point estimate - null value) / SE$
* Ratio of how the sample proportion differs from the hypothesized proportion as compared to the expected variability of the p values

#### Proportion Z-Score
$Z = (p - p_0)/ \sqrt{(p_0(1-p_0))/n}$
