##### Questions
The distribution to a single sample will always have a similar shape to the population distribution
* False

We quantify the variation of the point estimates in a sampling distribution by using:
* The standard deviation of the sampling distribution , which is called the standard error

Given that an "estimator" is a random variable whose distribution is the sampling distribution for a population parameter, a point estimate is an observation of a random variable.
* True

When considering the set of plots above, sample size has a similar influence on the distribution of sample proportions as it does the distribution of other point estimates
* True
An estimator is a random variable whose distribution is the sampling distribution for a particular sample size and population parameter
* True

Why don't we always take a large number of samples when exploring sampling distributions so we can get a nice, smooth distribution like the own shown above?
* Taking a large number of samples is computationally expensive
* We can get a good approximation of the "smoother" sampling distribution by using less sample repetitions, but larger bin widths in our histogram
