##### Types of Questions
**Inferential Questions:** A question that looks for patterns, trends, or relationships in a single data set and also asks for quantification of how applicable these findings are to a wider population
**Descriptive Questions:** A question that asks about summarized characteristics of a data set without interpretation
**Exploratory Questions:** A question that asks if there are patterns, trends, or relationships within a single data set. Often used to propose hypothesis for future study
**Predictive Questions:** A question that asks about predicting measurements or labels for individuals. The focus is on what things predict some outcome, but now what causes the outcome
**Casual Questions:** A question that asks about whether changing one factor will lead to a change in another factor, on average, in the wider population

##### Terms
**Mean:** The sum of all the data observations divided by how many observations there are
**Proportion:** The number of objects with a specific characteristic divided by the total number of objects
**Median:** The middle observation of a sorted variable's data
**Variance:** The mean of the sum of the squared distances of each observation from the mean value of all observations
**Standard Deviation:** The square root of the variance
**Correlation:** The strength and direction of the relationship between two variables

**Point Estimate:** A single number calculated from a sample that estimates an unknown population parameter of interest
**Population:** The entire set of objects of interest
**Population Parameter:** A numerical summary value. about the population
**Sample:** A subset of objects in the population
**Observation:** A quantity or quality or a set of these from a single member of a population
**Sampling Distribution:** A distribution of point estimates, where each point estimate was calculated from a different random sample from the same population

##### Concepts
* Sampling distributions are usually centred around the true population mean but is not always the same value as the true population mean
* Taking a random sample and calculating a point estimate is a "good guess" of the unknown population parameter

## Worksheet
##### Questions
What are two parameters typically used to describe the centre of a distribution?
* Median and Mean
Process of estimating a population parameter when we don't have access to the population
* Take a random sample from the population
* Calculate the point estimates for the samples
* Describe the uncertainty related to your estimate

**Sampling Distribution:** A representation of the spread of average values of samples that come rom the same population. It allows us to see how accurate and reliable the sample tests is by comparing the spread of the sample mean compared to the population parameter
