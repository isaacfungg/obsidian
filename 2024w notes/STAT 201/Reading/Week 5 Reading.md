#### Chapter 9 - Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis tests allow us to take a sample of data from a population and infer about the plausibility of competing hypotheses.
###### 

First, a **hypothesis** is a statement about the value of an unknown population parameter.

Second, a **hypothesis test** consists of a test between two competing hypotheses: (1) a **null hypothesis** H$_0$ (pronounced “H-naught”) versus (2) an **alternative hypothesis** H$_A$ (also denoted H$_1$).

Generally the null hypothesis is a claim that there is “no effect” or “no difference of interest.”

Furthermore, generally the alternative hypothesis is the claim the experimenter or researcher wants to establish or find evidence to support.

Third, a **test statistic** is a _point estimate/sample statistic_ formula used for hypothesis testing.

Fourth, the **observed test statistic** is the value of the test statistic that we observed in real life.

Fifth, the **null distribution** is the sampling distribution of the test statistic _assuming the null hypothesis H$_0$ is true_.

Sixth, the $p$-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic just as extreme or more extreme than the observed test statistic _assuming the null hypothesis H$_0$ is true.

Seventh and lastly, in many hypothesis testing procedures, it is commonly recommended to set the **significance level** of the test beforehand.
