***
`Bandwidth`: Maximum rate at which data can be sent over a link
`Latency`: Delay from when something is sent until it is received
* Packet latency: from start of sending packet until completely received
* Bit/byte latency: from start of sending bit/byte until that bit/byte is completely received
Data sizes: KB, MB, GB, TB (in bytes) 
* K, M, G, T are multiples of 2  ($2^{10}$, $2^{20}$, $2^{30}$, $2^{40}$) â€¢ Except for disk drive manufacturers 
Rates: Kbps, Mbps, Gbps, Tbps 
* K, M, G, T are multiples of 10 ($10^3$, $10^6$, $10^9$, $10^{12}$) 
* If KB/s, MB/s, GB/s, TB/s, then use multiples of 2 ($2^{10}$, $2^{20}$, $2^{30}$, $2^{40}$)
