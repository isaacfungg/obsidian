***
#### Procedure Calls
`Method Invocation`: Causes the method to run with:
* Values bound to arguments
* Possible result bound to the invocation

```cpp
# Caller
# goto ping (jump)
# continue executing
void foo () {
	ping();
}

# Callee
# do whatever ping does
# return to ???
void ping() {
	// do stuff
}
```

Return is a jump but to where?
* It is dynamic and jumps back to wherever called it

`Return address`: The address a procedure jumps to when it completes


#### Implementing Procedure Return
* The caller must provide the address by saving it before it makes the call
* **Convention**: caller will save the return address in r[6]
*
