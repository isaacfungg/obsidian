***
#### Procedure Calls
`Method Invocation`: Causes the method to run with:
* Values bound to arguments
* Possible result bound to the invocation

```cpp
# Caller
# goto ping (jump)
# continue executing
void foo () {
	ping();
}

# Callee
# do whatever ping does
# return to ???
void ping() {
	// do stuff
}
```

Return is a jump but to where?
* It is dynamic and jumps back to wherever called it

`Return address`: The address a procedure jumps to when it completes


#### Implementing Procedure Return
* The caller must provide the address by saving it before it makes the call
* **Convention**: caller will save the return address in r[6]

#### Procedure Activation
`Activation`: Starts when procedure is called, ends when it returns
`Activation Frame`: Memory that stores activation's state (Included local variables and arguments)
* We cannot be sure in general when or how many times a procedure will be activated, so these frames must be dynamically allocated
* **Freed** in reverse order of allocation

#### Runtime Stack
Stack of activation frames
* Stored in memory, grows up from bottom

Stack Pointer
* General purpose register (r5)
* Stores base address of the current frame

First activation is the "bottom" of the stack

#### What is Stored in an Activation Frame?
* `Local Variables`
* `Arguments`
* `Return Address`
	* Register r6 works for one call, but not for multiple calls

#### Allocating and Deallocating Stack Frames
`Decrement` the stack pointer to allocate
`Increment` the stack pointer to free

`Caller` allocates space for arguments
`Callee` allocated space for the rest

#### Stack Frame
`Procedure Prologue`: Code that executes just before procedure starts
* Part in `caller` before call
* Part in `callee` at beginning of call
**Allocates** activation frame and changes stack pointer
* Subtract frame size from stack pointer r5

`Procedure Epilogue`: Code than executes when procedure ends
* Part in `callee` just before return
* Part in `caller` just before returning
**Deallocates** activation frame and restores stack pointer
* Add frame size to stack pointer r5

#### Allocating and Deallocating Stack Frames
`Caller Prologue` (before call)
* Allocate space for arguments
* Save actual argument values to stack
`Callee Prologue` (Start of function code)
* Allocate space for return address/local variables
* Save return address to stack, if needed
`Callee Epilogue` (End of function code)
* Load return address from stack if stored there
* Deallocate space of return address/local variables
`Caller Epilogue` (After return from call)
* Deallocate space of arguments

#### Creating the Stack
Every program thread starts with a hidden procedure

The start procedure:
* Allocates memory for stack
* Initializes the stack pointer
* Calls the thread's first procedure
