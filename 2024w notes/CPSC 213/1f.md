#### Dynamic Control Flow
Functions have addresses so we can make `pointers` to functions
**Useful for:**
* Polymorphism
* Generic operations
* Jump tables

`Function pointer`
* A **variable** that stores the **address** of a **procedure**
* Declaration: <return-type> (*<var-name>)(<argument-list>);
