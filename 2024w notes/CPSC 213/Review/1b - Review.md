***

#### CPU
* Execute **instructions**, not C or Java code
* Execution proceeds in **stages**
	* `Fetch`: Load the next instruction from memory
	* `Decode`: Figure out from instruction what needs to be done
	* `Execute`: Do what the instruction asks

#### Computation
* Anything the **compiler can compute** is called `static`
* Anything that can only be discovered during execution is called `dynamic`
*
