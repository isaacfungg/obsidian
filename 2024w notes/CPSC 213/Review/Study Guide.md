C Programming
* Our compare function right now can only compare ints 
* We want to change it so we pass in a function pointer to a compare function that deals with the current type
* We would need to change the paras in the function ptr to void*
* **Second part
* How do we call it



#### Final Notes
* Program Counter: address of the next instruction to execute
* Jumps using relative addressing are called branches
* Memory Bus: Control path connecting CPU, main memory, and I/O bus
* I/O bus: Data control path connecting memory bus and I/O controllers
* I/O Controller: A processor running software that connects I/O Device to I/O Device
* I/O Device: I/O mechanism that generates or consumes data

PIO Limitations
* Reading/Writing large amounts of data slows CPU
I/O Controller cannot initiate communication
* Sometimes CPU asks for data
