#### Column Transformer
```Python
from sklearn.compose import make_column_transformer

ct = make_column_transformer(    
    (StandardScaler(), numeric_feats),  # scaling on numeric features
    ("passthrough", passthrough_feats),  # no transformations on the binary features    
    (OneHotEncoder(), categorical_feats),  # OHE on categorical features
    ("drop", drop_feats),  # drop the drop features
)
```
* In Column Transformer we can separate the columns
