***
* Larger alpha leads to smaller coefficients (less overfitting)


`Mean Squared Error`
* The score depends on the scale of the targets

`Root Mean Squared Error`
* More relatable metric would be the root mean squared error

$R^2$ Score
* $R^2(y, \hat{y}) = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2}$
* $\hat{y_i}$ = Mean of all observed values
* $\bar{y}$ = Predicted Value
