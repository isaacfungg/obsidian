`Endocytosis`
* Cellular process where cells absorb molecules or particles from outside the cell by engulfing them with their cell membrane
* This results in the formation of a vesicle containing materials inside the cell

`Excocytosis`
* Process by which cells expel materials from inside the cell to the exterior
* Achieved by the fusion of vesicles containing the materials with the cell membrane

#### The Cell Cycle - 10.2
* `Cell Cycle`
	* Ordered series of events involving cell growth and cell division that produces two new daughter cells
	* **G1**
		* Cell is growing
		* Muscle and nerve cell exit at G1 because they don't divide
		* Checks for size, nutrients, molecular signals, DNA integrity
	* **S**
		* A copy of the DNA is made
	* **G2
		* Preparation for cell division
		* Checks for DNA integrity, DNA replication
	* **M
		* Mitosis (division of cells nucleus)
		* Cytokinesis (division of cytoplasm)
* `Interphase`
	* The cell grows and DNA is replicated
* `Mitotic Phase`
	* The replicated DNA and cytoplasmic contents are separated
	* Cell cytoplasm is typically partitioned by a third process called cytokinesis

`Oxidation`
* Process of molecules losing electrons

`Reduction`
* Process of molecules gaining electrons

#### Base Pairing
* We call the end with the phosphate 5'
* The end with a hydroxyl is called 3'
* In DNA - > A = T, G = C
* In RNA -> A = U, G = C
* The complementary strand runs in the opposite direction *antiparallel*
