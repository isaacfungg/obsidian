`Endocytosis`
* Cellular process where cells absorb molecules or particles from outside the cell by engulfing them with their cell membrane
* This results in the formation of a vesicle containing materials inside the cell

`Excocytosis`
* Process by which cells expel materials from inside the cell to the exterior
* Achieved by the fusion of vesicles containing the materials with the cell membrane
