`Ecosystem`
* The biological communities, the physical, non-biological attributes, plus all the associated properties/characteristics and interactions in a relatively well defined geographic area.

#### Energy Flow
* `Trophic Levels`
	* The position in the energy flow of the ecosystem
* `Food Chain`
	* Linear transfer of energy from one trophic level to the next
	* Why food chain do not accurately depict the relationships of organism with respect of energy flow
		* One species of organism can feed on more than one species of prey
		- One species of organism can be food/prey for more than one species of predator.
* `Food Web`
	* The transfer of energy in an ecosystem can be more accurately depicted as a food web (linked food chains).

#### Energy Efficiency
* Why isn't there predators that hunt tigers?
	* It has to do with the efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels
* Not all of the energy at one tropic level flows to the next trophic level
* A considerable amount of energy (~80-95%) is lost, as heat at each step in the food chain/food web
* `Ten Percent Rule`
	* Only about 10% of the chemical energy available at one trophic level is transferred and stored in usable form in the bodies of organisms at the next trophic level.


###### Exam Question
* You collected data on the biomass of multiple taxa within an ecosystem.  Identify trophic level (e.g. 1° consumer). Assuming ~90% energy loss between trophic levels, **draw a food web**.   **2 minutes, discuss with your neighbours
