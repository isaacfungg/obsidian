#### Ecosystem Functions
* Biological, biogeochemical, or biophysical processes that occur within an ecosystem
* Examples:
	- Carbon sequestration
	- Nitrogen fixation
	- Detoxification and purification
	- Pollination
	- Moderate local climates
- `Ecosystem services:` ecosystem function(s) that is/are particularly beneficial to humans.
- **Examples:**
	- Carbon sequestration – benefits humans by reducing greenhouse effect
	- Pollination – benefits humans by maintaining key plant species (e.g. food crops)

#### Extinction
* **Specialists** are more likely to go extinct than generalists.
	* The food that they eat may be more limited
* **In animals, risk increases for:** 
	- K-selected animals
	- Larger territorial ranges
	- Smaller geographic ranges
	- Higher trophic level
	- Specialists
	- Those living close to human population centres

#### Drivers of Biodiversity Loss
- **Habitat loss -** conversion of an ecosystem to another use.
- **Habitat degradation** - changes that reduce quality of the habitat for many, but not all, species.
- **Habitat fragmentation -** breaking up of continuous habitat into habitat patches amid a human-dominated landscape.
- **Non-indigenous** species: has been released outside its native range AKA non-native, alien
- **Invasive** species: introduced species that increases its range and population size rapidly to the detriment of native species
	- Compete with native species for food
	- Their predators may no longer be at the new location
