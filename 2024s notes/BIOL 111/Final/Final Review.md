#### Week 1
`Deductive thinking`
* Based on logic
`Inductive thinking`
* Extending a rule that we know is true and based on some previous experiences or observations to new or unfamiliar situations

`Passive Transport`
* Does not require external energy

`Diffusion`
* Passive transport process where molecules move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration
* The rate of diffusion is determined by the distance the substance needs to travel and the surface area allowed for diffusion
* Cells are very small because of the efficiency of diffusion (less distance and more surface area)

`Facilitated Diffusion`
* Passive transport method but involves the use of protein channels or carriers in the cell membrane to help specific molecules such as glucose and ions across the membrane
* Mainly for molecules too large for diffusion

`Active Transport`
* Requires energy to move molecules against their concentration gradient

`Typical Cell - Characteristics`
* Cell membrane
* Cytoplasm
* DNA
* Ribosomes (to make proteins based on the DNA)

`Osmosis`: The movement of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the water's concentration gradient across the membrane, which is inversely proportional to the solutes' concentration

`Hypertonic`
* The solute concentration outside the cell is lower than inside the cell
* Water moves into the cell

`Hypertonic`
* The solute concentration outside the cell is higher than inside the cell
* Water moves out of the cell

`Endocytosis`
* Process involves the cell takin gin substances by enveloping them in a section of its own membrane

`Exocytosis`
* Involves the cell expelling materials. Vesicles within the cell fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing their contents to the outside of the cell.

`Endosymbiotic Theory`
* A theory that explains the origin of certain organelles in eukaryotic cells, particularly mitochondria and chloroplasts
* These organelles still have their own DNA

`Lipids`
* Long chains of carbon and hydrogen
* They don't interact well with water - hydrophobic
* Important energy sources

`Carbohydrates`
* Hydrophilic
* Primary source of energy for most organisms
* Can be chained together for storage (starch) or for structural purposes (cellulose)

`Proteins`
* Made up of amino acids
* Provide structural support

`Autotrophs`
* Fix carbon, converting them into organic compounds

`Heterotrophs`
* Eat autotrophs containing the fixed carbon

`Photosynthesis`
* Sets off the process of carbon cycle
###### What is unique to eukaryotes?
* Organelles, Mitochondria
###### How do bacteria survive in different osmotic conditions?
* They cannot survive in hypertonic environments
* In a hypotonic environment, bacteria cell wall provide a rigid structure to counter the cell swelling due to influx of water. Eventually, the water pressure inside the cell balance out the force that drives the water into the cell
###### How come antibiotics destroy bacteria but do not harm eukaryotic cells?
* It weakens bacterial cell walls. Eukaryotic cell walls are mostly made of cellulose.
###### Difference between plant and animal cells?
* Cell wall
* Vacuoles
* Chloroplasts
###### What do carbs, protein and nucleic acids have in common?
* They are all made from monomers
