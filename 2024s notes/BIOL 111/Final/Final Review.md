#### Week 1
`Deductive thinking`
* Based on logic
`Inductive thinking`
* Extending a rule that we know is true and based on some previous experiences or observations to new or unfamiliar situations

`Passive Transport`
* Does not require external energy

%% `Diffusion`
* Passive transport process where molecules move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration
* The rate of diffusion is determined by the distance the substance needs to travel and the surface area allowed for diffusion
* Cells are very small because of the efficiency of diffusion (less distance and more surface area)

`Facilitated Diffusion`
* Passive transport method but involves the use of protein channels or carriers in the cell membrane to help specific molecules such as glucose and ions across the membrane
* Mainly for molecules too large for diffusion %%

`Active Transport`
* Requires energy to move molecules against their concentration gradient

`Typical Cell - Characteristics`
* Cell membrane
* Cytoplasm
* DNA
* Ribosomes (to make proteins based on the DNA)

%% `Osmosis`: The movement of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the water's concentration gradient across the membrane, which is inversely proportional to the solutes' concentration %%

%% `Hypotonic`
* The solute concentration outside the cell is lower than inside the cell
* Water moves into the cell

`Hypertonic`
* The solute concentration outside the cell is higher than inside the cell
* Water moves out of the cell %%

%% `Endocytosis`
* Process involves the cell takin gin substances by enveloping them in a section of its own membrane

`Exocytosis`
* Involves the cell expelling materials. Vesicles within the cell fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing their contents to the outside of the cell. %%

%% `Endosymbiotic Theory`
* A theory that explains the origin of certain organelles in eukaryotic cells, particularly mitochondria and chloroplasts
* These organelles still have their own DNA %%

%% `Lipids`
* Long chains of carbon and hydrogen
* They don't interact well with water - hydrophobic
* Important energy sources

`Carbohydrates`
* Hydrophilic
* Primary source of energy for most organisms
* Can be chained together for storage (starch) or for structural purposes (cellulose)

`Proteins`
* Made up of amino acids
* Provide structural support %%
%% 
`Autotrophs`
* Fix carbon, converting them into organic compounds

`Heterotrophs`
* Eat autotrophs containing the fixed carbon %%

`Photosynthesis`
* Sets off the process of carbon cycle
###### What is unique to eukaryotes?
* Organelles, Mitochondria
###### How do bacteria survive in different osmotic conditions?
* They cannot survive in hypertonic environments
* In a hypotonic environment, bacteria cell wall provide a rigid structure to counter the cell swelling due to influx of water. Eventually, the water pressure inside the cell balance out the force that drives the water into the cell
###### How come antibiotics destroy bacteria but do not harm eukaryotic cells?
* It weakens bacterial cell walls. Eukaryotic cell walls are mostly made of cellulose.
###### Difference between plant and animal cells?
* Cell wall
* Vacuoles
* Chloroplasts
###### What do carbs, protein and nucleic acids have in common?
* They are all made from monomers


#### Week 2
`Nucleic Acids`
%% * Chains of nucleotides are used to store genetic sequence information
* Base: Determines the identity of the nucleotide
* Nucleotide: Sugar + base + 1 to 3 phosphates %%

%% `Genome`
* All the genetic material in an organism passed from parent to offspring

`Genes`
* Basic unit of heredity
* Can encode proteins
* Can encode functional RNAs %%

###### DNA vs RNA
* RNA uses ribose while DNA uses deoxyribose
* DNA is much more stable than RNA
* RNA uses U while DNA uses T

###### Base Pairing
* We call the end with the phosphate 5'
* The end with a hydroxyl is called 3'
* New nucleotides are added at the 3' end
* Starts at AUG

###### Why do you think cells divide?
* To form a certain structure while an organism is growing
* To replace injured cells
* To replace cells that die at the end of their life span

###### Cell Cycle
* Has 4 different stages: G1, S, G2, and M
* Interphase: G1, S, G2
	* G1 - Cell Growth
		* Checkpoint ensures that everything is ready for DNA synthesis
		* Size, nutrients, molecular signals, DNA integrity
	* S - Synthesis
		* DNA replication
	* G2 - Growth + preparation for mitosis
		* Checkpoint ensures that everything is ready for M phase
		* DNA integrity
		* DNA replication
* M: Mitosis and cytokinesis (cell division)


#### Week 4
%% `Biological Evolution`
* A change in the (heritable) characteristics of a population over generations
`Microevolution`
* Changes in allele frequencies in a population in a relative short period of time
`Macroevolution`
* Evolution that occurs at or above the species level %%

%% `Homology`
* Similarity between species that results from the inheritance of traits from a common ancestor
	* Structural (morphological traits)
	* Developmental (embryonic structures/processes)
	* Genetic (gene structure and the genetic code)

`Analogous traits`
* Independent solution to an environmental demand
* Not inherited from a common ancestor
* Due to convergent evolution %%

###### Four Mechanisms of Evolution
`Mutation`
* Formerly unknown alleles in a population
* Base substitutions or base insertions or deletions
* Only 2% of DNA codes for proteins so it is rare
* Considered a weak evolutionary mechanism
* Ultimate source of genetic variation
`Genetic Drift`
* Random fluctuations in allele frequencies due to chance
* More likely to occur in small isolated populations
	* `Population Bottleneck`
		* Population size decreases rapidly over a short period of time (e.g fire)
		* Reduces the number and diversity of alleles that can pass to the next generation
	* `Founder Effect`
		* New population is founded by a few individuals (colonization)
`Gene Flow`
* Movements of individuals in and out of populations resulting in change in allele frequencies
* Can introduce new alleles into a population
* Lack of gene flow between population can lead to genetic divergence
`Natural Selection`
* Increase in the frequency of advantageous alleles in a population due to differential survival and reproduction
	* Three requirements
		* Variation in a certain trait
		* The trait is heritable
		* More offspring are produced than can possibly survive
		* 

`Fitness`
* Refers to the capability of an organism to produce viable offspring relative to others in the population
	* Female Fitness
		*  Energetically expensive
		* Limited by ability to obtain resources for producing eggs
	* Male Fitness
		* Energetically inexpensive
		* Limited by the number of females they can mate with
`Adaptation`
* Heritable traits that increases the fitness of individuals

#### Week 5
`Species`
* Group of organisms that can reproduce with each other and produce viable offspring and is reproductively isolated from other organisms
`Speciation`
* Evolutionary process of by which new species form
* 3 Steps
	* Gene flow stops - Genetically isolated
	* Isolated populations diverge genetically
		* Due to mutations, natural selection or genetic drift
	* Reproductive isolation
* `Allopatric Speciation`
	* Geographic separation of populations
	* No gene flow between populations
	* `Vicariance`
		* Physical splitting of one population into two or more 
	* `Dispersal`
		* A few members of a population move to a new area
* `Sympatric Speciation`
	* No physical barrier to separate individuals in a population

`Prezygotic reproductive barrier`

* Young have high mortality 
* High mortality prevents populations from reaching _K_
* Tend to be organisms  that are adapted to environmentally unstable/unpredictable environments

`K-selected Life History Strategy
* Heavy investment in parental care
* Long-lived organisms with a long period of maturations before becoming reproductively mature
* Offspring have a higher chance of surviving
* More common in high-quality and competitive environments
