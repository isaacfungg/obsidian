#### Properties of Life - 1.2
* Order - Structural organization within living organism
* Sensitivity or response to the environment
* Reproduction
* Adaptation
* Growth and development
* Homeostasis
* Energy processing
* Evolution

#### Endosymbiotic Theory
* A theory that explains the origin of certain organelles in eukaryotic cells, particularly mitochondria and chloroplasts
* These organelles originated from free-living prokaryotes that were engulfed by an ancestral eukaryotic cell and formed a symbiotic relationship

###### Evidence
* Mitochondria and chloroplasts really look like bacteria with their two membranes

#### 3.2 Carbohydrates 
* `Monosaccharides`: Simple sugars, the most common of which is glucose
* `Disaccharides`: Form when two monosaccharides undergo a dehydration reaction
* `Polysaccharides`: A long chain of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds


***
`Hypertonic`
* The solute concentration outside the cell is lower than inside the cell
* Water moves into the cell

`Hypertonic`
* The solute concentration outside the cell is higher than inside the cell
* Water moves out of the cell

`Oxidation`
* Process of molecules losing electrons

`Reduction`
* Process of molecules gaining electrons
