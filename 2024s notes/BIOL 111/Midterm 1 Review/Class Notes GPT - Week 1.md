Scientific Thinking:
- Deductive Thinking: Logic-based, such as the principle of elimination.
- Inductive Thinking: Extending known rules to new situations.

Scientific Methodology:
1. Observations and questions.
2. Form hypotheses based on observations.
3. Make predictions based on hypotheses.
4. Test hypotheses through experiments or observations.

Characteristics of Living Things:
1. Organized/orderly structure.
2. Response to external stimuli.
3. Growth and development.
4. Reproduction.
5. Maintenance of a stable internal environment (homeostasis).
6. Use and processing of energy.

Cell Theory:
1. All organisms are composed of one or more cells.
2. Cells are the basic structural and functional unit of all living organisms.
3. Cells arise only from pre-existing cells.
    

Cell Structure and Function:
- Cell Membrane: Semi-permeable barrier made of phospholipids, cholesterol, and proteins.
- Fluid Mosaic Model: Membrane is a mosaic of components that can move around, contributing to its fluid nature.
    

Transport Across Cell Membranes:

- Passive Transport: No energy required, movement along the concentration gradient, sometimes using protein channels.
- Facilitated Transport: Example includes glucose transport via a carrier protein.

Transport Across Membranes:
- Chemical Gradients:
	- Inside cell: High [K+]
	- Outside cell: Low [K+]
- K+ flows from inside to outside without energy input (passive transport).
- Active Transport:
	- Moves substances against their electrochemical gradient.
	- Requires energy, usually from ATP.
    

Sodium-Potassium Pump (Na+/K+ ATPase):
- Found in all animal cells.
- Moves 3 Na+ out and 2 K+ into the cell.
- Maintains a negatively charged internal environment and high [Na+] outside.

Electrochemical Gradients:
- Created by active transport.
- Serve as a source of potential energy for other processes.

Absorption of Nutrients:
- Glucose: Absorbed into intestinal cells using the sodium gradient.
- Na+ moves into cells along its gradient, bringing glucose with it.

Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes:
- Unique to Eukaryotes: Organelles, mitochondria.
- Prokaryotic examples: Archaea and Bacteria.

Tonicity:
- Critical for cell volume regulation.
- Hypotonic environment: Cell swells.
- Hypertonic environment: Cell shrinks.

Plant vs. Animal Cells:
- Plant cells have cell walls, vacuoles, chloroplasts.
- Animal cells lack these structures.

Endosymbiotic Theory:
- Mitochondria and chloroplasts originated from engulfed bacteria.
- Evidence: Own DNA, similar to bacteria, divide by fission.

Organic Molecules:
- Backbone of carbon; includes carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, nucleic acids.
- Carbon fixation is crucial for creating these molecules.

Building Blocks of Life:
- Lipids: Hydrophobic, energy sources.
- Carbohydrates: Energy-rich, hydrophilic.
- Proteins: Chains of amino acids, diverse functions.
- Nucleic Acids: Information storage.

Photosynthesis and Carbon Cycle:
- Autotrophs fix carbon, heterotrophs consume autotrophs.
- Nutrient processing involves both anabolic and catabolic reactions.

Diet and Metabolism:
- Excess carbohydrates are converted to fats or used for energy.
- Metabolism includes all chemical reactions in the body.
