Cell Membrane:
- Acts as a boundary, maintaining homeostasis.
- Selectively permeable: allows some materials to pass while blocking others.
    

Transport Across Membranes:
- Facilitated Transport/Diffusion: Moves substances without energy (e.g., glucose via carrier protein).
- Osmosis: Water diffusion from high to low concentration.
- Active Transport: Moves substances against their gradient using energy from ATP.
- Endocytosis and Exocytosis: Move large materials into and out of cells, respectively, requiring energy.


Macromolecules:
- Lipids, Carbohydrates, Proteins, Nucleic Acids:
- Lipids: Hydrophobic, energy sources.
- Carbohydrates: Energy-rich, hydrophilic.
- Proteins: Chains of amino acids, diverse functions.
- Nucleic Acids: Store genetic information.
    
Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration:
- Photosynthesis: Converts CO2 and water into oxygen and carbohydrates using solar energy.
- Cellular Respiration: Converts glucose and oxygen into CO2, water, and ATP, releasing energy.
    

ATP as Energy Currency:
- Energy from breaking down sugars and lipids fuels ATP production.
- ATP stores and transfers energy within cells.
    

DNA and RNA:
- DNA: Stable, double-stranded, stores genetic information.
- RNA: Less stable, single-stranded, involved in protein synthesis.
- Nucleotides: Building blocks of DNA and RNA, consisting of a sugar, base, and phosphate group.
    

Cell Division:
- Cell Cycle: Includes G1 (growth), S (DNA synthesis), G2 (preparation for mitosis), and M (mitosis and cytokinesis).
- Checkpoints: Ensure proper cell size, nutrient availability, and DNA integrity before proceeding.
    

Genome:
- All genetic material in an organism.
- Genes: Basic units of heredity, encoding proteins or functional RNAs.
- Human genome: Approximately 3 billion base pairs.
- Differentiated cells have the same genome but express different subsets of genes.
