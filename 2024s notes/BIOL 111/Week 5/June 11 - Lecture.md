#### Speciation
Three Steps to Speciation (order is important) 
* `Gene flow stops
	* All or part of a population becomes genetically isolated from other members of the population/species
* `Isolated populations diverge genetically
	* Due to mutation, genetic drift, or natural selection affecting population independently
* `Reproductive isolation
	*  So, if two populations that have been isolated from each other come into contact again…
	- They would would be unable to mate, and/or could mate but produce offspring with low survivorship and/or low fitness.

#### Two Mechanisms of Speciation
* `Allopatric Speciation`
	* **Geographic separation** of populations (e.g. barrier or distance).
	- No gene flow between  populations
	- **Vicariance:** physical splitting of one  population into two or more  smaller populations due to the  formation of a geographic barrier, e.g. a river changing course, a road being built, a glacier forming
	- **Dispersal:** A few members of a population move to a new area (founder event).
- `Sympatric Speciation`
	- No physical barrier to separate individuals in a population.  
	- Some other mechanism results in **reproductive isolation** between populations

#### Reproductive Barriers
* `Prezygotic reproductive barriers` 
	* (before zygote) -hinders matings or prevents fertilization of the egg.
	* Difference in timing of reproduction
	* Habitat isolation
	* Behavioural - Difference in mating rituals
	* Gametic Barrier
* `Post-zygotic reproductive barriers`
	* (after zygote) -  hinders zygote development – reduced viability or fertility.
	* Hybrid Sterility or less fertile
	* Hybrid inviability
