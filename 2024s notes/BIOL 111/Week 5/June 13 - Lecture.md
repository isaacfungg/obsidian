#### Ecology
* Study of how organisms interact with one another  and with their **environment**.
* Two main goals of ecological research:
1. Identify and describe the patterns of distribution and abundance of organisms;
2. Understand these patterns, i.e. what factors (abiotic or biotic) are influencing these patterns

`Community Ecology`
* How do species interact with one another and how these interactions affect community structure and dynamics?

`Ecosystem Ecology`
* How do energy flow through and nutrients cycle through an ecosystem?

`Abiotic Factors`
* Temperature, light intensity, water availability

`Biotic Factors`
* Predation, competition, mutualism

#### Population
Under what conditions can we realistically expect **exponential growth** to occur?
* Usually short-lived, and occurs when:
	- Resources are unlimited, and
	- Population sizes are relatively small;


#### Logistic Growth
* In logistic growth, the population growth rate ( _r_ ) declines as the population size gets closer its **carrying capacity (K).**
*  **_r_ will get smaller** as the population gets bigger and   resources are depleted
- The population should fluctuate around K
- Carrying capacity K for a particular species is not constant and can change over time


#### Limiting Factors
`Density-dependent factors`
* Influence on population size or population growth depends upon the number of individuals in a population/population density
* E.g Competition, predation, disease

`Density-independent factors`
* Influence population size and population growth regardless of population size/population density.
* E.g hurricanes, volcano

#### Survivorship Curves
* `Type 1`
	* Most survive and until old age
	* e.g. Humans and elephants
* `Type 2`
	* Constant proportion of deaths per age
	* e.g. Birds and lizards
* `Type 3`
	* Most die at young age
	* e.g. Fish and plants

#### r-selected Life History Strategy
* Maximizes reproduction
* Limited investment in offspring
* Young have high mortality 
* High mortality prevents populations from reaching _K_
* Tend to be organisms  that are adapted to environmentally unstable/unpredictable environments

#### K-selected Life History Strategy
* Heavy investment in parental care
* Long-lived organisms with a long period of maturations before becoming reproductively mature
* Offspring have a higher chance of surviving
* More common in high-quality and competitive environments


#### Ecological succession
* `Succession`
	* The change in community composition over time
	* e.g. Early plant communities create conditions that allow later plant communities to survive
* Succession stops (temporarily) when a **climax community** is reached.
- The climax community will exist until a **disturbance** occurs (which restarts the succession process.)

* `Primary succession`
	* Follows a disturbance that was sufficiently extreme to remove all the soil  and all living organisms
	* Organisms need to start from scratch
		* Called pioneering species

* `Secondary succession`
	* Follows a  disturbance that has removed some  or all living organisms, but some of the soil remains.
	* An example of secondary succession would be succession following a forest fire.

* `Early Succession`
	* Abiotic conditions in early succession can be harsh (e.g. no protection from wind, direct sunlight (and associated UV radiation), extremes of temperature, nutrients may or may not be present).
	* Competition is low because relatively few species are present in early succession.
* `Later Succession`
	* Abiotic conditions are less harsh (e.g. plants provide shade and protection from wind).
	- Competition for limited resources can be intense.

#### Learning Goals - Succession
- Given a scenario, be able to explain whether primary or secondary succession is occurring.
- Be able to identify the successional stage of a community (early, mid, late).
- Identify the general life history characteristics of species found at different successional stages in a forest biome (e.g., dispersal ability, competitive ability).
- Be able to describe/explain how abiotic or biotic conditions change with the successional stage of the community.
- Given a scenario be able to identify/list disturbances that can affect the successional stage of a community.
