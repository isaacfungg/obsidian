#### Ecology
* Study of how organisms interact with one anotherÂ  and with their **environment**.
* Two main goals of ecological research:
1. Identify and describe the patterns of distribution and abundance of organisms;
2. Understand these patterns, i.e. what factors (abiotic or biotic) are influencing these patterns

`Community Ecology`
* How do species interact with one another and how these interactions affect community structure and dynamics?

`Ecosystem Ecology`
* How do energy flow through and nutrients cycle through an ecosystem?

`Abiotic Factors`
* Temperature, light intensity, water availability

`Biotic Factors`
* Predation, competition, mutualism
