#### Ecology
* Study of how organisms interact with one another  and with their **environment**.
* Two main goals of ecological research:
1. Identify and describe the patterns of distribution and abundance of organisms;
2. Understand these patterns, i.e. what factors (abiotic or biotic) are influencing these patterns

`Community Ecology`
* How do species interact with one another and how these interactions affect community structure and dynamics?

`Ecosystem Ecology`
* How do energy flow through and nutrients cycle through an ecosystem?

`Abiotic Factors`
* Temperature, light intensity, water availability

`Biotic Factors`
* Predation, competition, mutualism

#### Population
Under what conditions can we realistically expect **exponential growth** to occur?
* Usually short-lived, and occurs when:
	- Resources are unlimited, and
	- Population sizes are relatively small;


#### Logistic Growth
* In logistic growth, the population growth rate ( _r_ ) declines as the population size gets closer its **carrying capacity (K).**
*  **_r_ will get smaller** as the population gets bigger and   resources are depleted
- The population should fluctuate around K
- Carrying capacity K for a particular species is not constant and can change over time


#### Limiting Factors
`Density-dependent factors`
* Influence on population size or population growth depends upon the number of individuals in a population/population density
* E.g Competition, predation, disease

`Density-independent factors`
* Influence population size and population growth regardless of population size/population density.
* E.g hurricanes, volcano

#### Survivorship Curves
* `Type 1`
	* Most survive and until old age
	* e.g. Humans and elephants
* `Type 2`
	* Constant proportion of deaths per age
	* e.g. Birds and lizards
* `Type 3`
	* Most die at young age
	* e.g. Fish and plants
