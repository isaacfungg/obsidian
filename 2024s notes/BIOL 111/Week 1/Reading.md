#### 1.2 Themes and Concepts in Biology - Properties of Life
* All organisms share several key characteristics or functions:
	* Order
	* Sensitivity or response to the environment
	* Reproduction
	* Adaption
	* Growth and development
	* Regulation/homeostasis
	* Energy processing
	* Evolution

#### 4.1 Studying Cell - Cell Theory
* Anthony van Leeuwenhoek observed the movements of single-celled organisms, which he collectively termed "**animalcules**"
* In 1665, Robert Hooke coined the term "cell" for the box-like structures he observed when viewing cork tissue though a lens
* `Unified Cell Theory`: One or more cells comprise all living things, the cell is the basic unit of life, and new cells arise from existing cells

#### 5.1 Components and Structure of Cell Membrane - Fluid Mosaic Model
* Davson and Danielli theorized that the plasma membrane's structure resembles a sandwich
* Compared *Proteins* -> *Bread* and *Lipids* -> *Filling*
* `Fluid Mosaic Model`: Describes the plasma membrane structure as a mosaic of components.


#### 5.2 Passive Transport - Selective Permeability
* Plasma membranes are asymmetric
* Considerable difference between the array of phospholipids and proteins between two leaflets that form a membrane
*
