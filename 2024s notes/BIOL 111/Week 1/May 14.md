#### Diffusion
* The rate of diffusion is determined by a few variables:
	* Distance the substance needs to travel
	* The surface area allowed for diffusion

#### Plasma Membrane
* Semi-permeable, selective barrier encasing the cell
* Mostly made of phospholipids, cholesterol, and proteins with highly specialized functions

`Mosaic`: A variety of different components comprise the membrane
`Fluid`: Different elements/components can move around the membrane

#### Cell Membrane
* To maintain homeostasis, the cell membrane separates the outside world from inside and allows certain substances to pass through while blocks others

###### Crossing the Membrane
* Passive transport requires no energy, but may sometimes require a protein to serve as a channel or pore to help with the movement
* A *transport protein* uses energy to move that substance across the membrane


#### Osmosis
* Process by which water molecules move across a semi-permeable membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration.


`Concentration gradient`: Unequal concentrations of one type of molecule inside vs. outside of the cell
`Electrical Gradient`: Unequal distribution of charged molecules inside vs. outside of the cell
