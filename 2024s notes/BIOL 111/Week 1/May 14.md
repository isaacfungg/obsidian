#### Diffusion
* The rate of diffusion is determined by a few variables:
	* Distance the substance needs to travel
	* The surface area allowed for diffusion

#### Plasma Membrane
* Semi-permeable, selective barrier encasing the cell
* Mostly made of phospholipids, cholesterol, and proteins with highly specialized functions

`Mosaic`: A variety of different components comprise the membrane
`Fluid`: Different elements/components can move around the membrane

#### Cell Membrane
