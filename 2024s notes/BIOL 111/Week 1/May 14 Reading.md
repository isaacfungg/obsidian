#### 1.2 Themes and Concepts in Biology - Properties of Life
* All organisms share several key characteristics or functions:
	* Order
	* Sensitivity or response to the environment
	* Reproduction
	* Adaption
	* Growth and development
	* Regulation/homeostasis
	* Energy processing
	* Evolution

#### 4.1 Studying Cell - Cell Theory
* Anthony van Leeuwenhoek observed the movements of single-celled organisms, which he collectively termed "**animalcules**"
* In 1665, Robert Hooke coined the term "cell" for the box-like structures he observed when viewing cork tissue though a lens
* `Unified Cell Theory`: One or more cells comprise all living things, the cell is the basic unit of life, and new cells arise from existing cells

#### 5.1 Components and Structure of Cell Membrane - Fluid Mosaic Model
* Davson and Danielli theorized that the plasma membrane's structure resembles a sandwich
* Compared *Proteins* -> *Bread* and *Lipids* -> *Filling*
* `Fluid Mosaic Model`: Describes the plasma membrane structure as a mosaic of components.

#### 5.2 Passive Transport - Selective Permeability
* Plasma membranes are asymmetric
* Considerable difference between the array of phospholipids and proteins between two leaflets that form a membrane
#### 5.2 Passive Transport - Diffusion
* `Diffusion`: A passive process of transport
* A single substance moves from a high concentration to a low concentration area until the concentration is equal across a space

#### 5.2 Passive Transport - Osmosis
* `Osmosis`: The movement of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the water's concentration gradient across the membrane, which is inversely proportional to the solutes' concentration

#### 5.3 Active Transport
* `Active transport`: Require the cell's energy, usually in the form of *adenosine triphosphate* (ATP)
* Substances move from areas of lower concentration to areas of higher concentration, against the gradient

#### 4.2 Prokaryotic Cells
* All cells share four common components:
	* A plasma membrane
	* An outer covering that separates the cell's interior from its surrounding environment
	* DNA
	* Ribosomes, which synthesize proteins
* `Prokaryote`: A simple, mostly single-celled organism that lacks a nucleus, or any other membrane-bound organelle
* They are significantly smaller than *eukaryotic cells* (0.1 - 5.0 $\mu$m vs 10 - 100 $\mu$m)
* Its small size allows ions and organic molecules that enter them to quickly diffuse to other parts of the cell

#### 4.3 Eukaryotic Cells
* Unlike *prokaryotic cells*, `eukayotic cells` have:
	* A membrane-bound nucleus
	* Numerous membrane-bound organelles, Golgi apparatus, chloroplasts, mitochondria, and others
	* Several rod-shaped chromosomes

#### 23.1 Eukaryotic Origins - Endosymbiotic Theory
* `Endosymbiotic Theory`: Eukaryotes may have been a product of one cell engulfing another, one living within another, and coevolving over time until the separate cells were no longer recognizable as such and shared genetic control of a mutualistic metabolic pathway to produce ATP
