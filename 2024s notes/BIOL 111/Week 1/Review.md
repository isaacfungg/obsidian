#### Properties of Life - 1.2
* Order - Structural organization within living organism
* Sensitivity or response to the environment
* Reproduction
* Adaptation
* Growth and development
* Homeostasis
* Energy processing
* Evolution

#### Cell Theory - 4.1
* One or more cells comprise all living things, the cell is the basic unit of life, and new cells arise from existing cells

#### Prokaryotic Cells - 4.2
* All cells share four common components
	* Plasma membrane
	* Cytoplasm
	* DNA
	* Ribosomes
* `Prokaryote`
	* A simple, mostly single-celled (unicellular) organism that lacks a nucleus, or any other membrane-bound organelle
	* The cell wall acts as an extra layer of protection, helps the cell maintain its shape, and prevents dehydration
	* Since they are smaller they have an increased surface area to volume ratio
		* Faster rates of nutrient uptake and waste elimination
		* Faster growth and replication
		* Efficiency in resource use

#### Eukaryotic Cells - 4.3
* Unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells have:
	* A membrane-bound nucleus
	* Numerous membrane-bound **organelles**
	* Severed rod-shaped chromosomes
#### Passive Transport - 5.2
* Plasma membranes are asymmetric
* `Diffusion`
	* Passive process of transport
	* A single substance moves from a high concentration to a low concentration area until the concentration is equal across a space
	* Does **not** necessarily involve a membrane
* `Facilitated Transport`
	* Passive process of transport
	* Materials diffuse across the plasma membrane with the help of membrane proteins
	* A concentration gradient exists that would allow these materials to diffuse into the cell without expending cellular energy
* `Osmosis`
	* Movement of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the water's concentration gradient across the **membrane
	* Transports only water across a membrane and the membrane limits the solutes' diffusion in the water
	* High concentration to a low concentration
	* Low concentration may mean high solute concentration and high concentration may mean low solute concentration
	* Hypertonic and hypotonic

#### Active Transport - 5.3
* `Active Transport`
	* Requires the cell's energy, usually in the form of `adenosine triphosphate` (ATP)
	* If a substance must move into the cell against its concentration gradient the cell **must use energy** to move the substance
