#### Properties of Life - 1.2
* Order - Structural organization within living organism
* Sensitivity or response to the environment
* Reproduction
* Adaptation
* Growth and development
* Homeostasis
* Energy processing
* Evolution

#### Cell Theory - 4.1
* One or more cells comprise all living things, the cell is the basic unit of life, and new cells arise from existing cells

#### Selective Permeability - 5.2
* Plasma membranes are asymmetric
* `Diffusion`
	* Passive process of transport
	* A single substance moves from a high concentration to a low concentration area until the concentration is equal across a space
	* Does **not** necessarily involve a membrane
* `Facilitated Transport`
	* Passive process of transport
	* Materials diffuse across the plasma membrane with the help of membrane proteins
	* A concentration gradient exists that would allow these materials to diffuse into the cell without expending cellular energy
* `Osmosis`
	* Movement of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the water's concentration gradient across the **membrane
	* Transports only water across a membrane and the membrane limits the solutes' diffusion in the water
	* High concentration to a low concentration
	* Low concentration may mean high solute concentration and high concentration may mean low solute concentration
	* Hypertonic and hypotonic
