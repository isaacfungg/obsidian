#### 7.1 Energy in Living Systems
`Oxidization`: The removal of an electron from a molecule that results in a decrease in potential energy in the oxidized compound

###### ATP in Living Systems
* A living cell cannot store significant amounts of free energy
* Excess energy would result in an increase of heat in the cell that could damage and then destroy the cell
* `ATP`: Often called the "energy currency" of the cell and functions similarly to a rechargeable battery


#### DNA Replication
* Goes form 5' to 3' 
* Helicase splits up the double helix
* DNA polymerase fills in the gaps of the DNA
