#### 7.1 Energy in Living Systems
`Oxidization`: The removal of an electron from a molecule that results in a decrease in potential energy in the oxidized compound

###### ATP in Living Systems
* A living cell cannot store significant amounts of free energy
* Excess energy would result in an increase of heat in the cell that could damage and then destroy the cell
* `ATP`: Often called the "energy currency" of the cell and functions similarly to a rechargeable battery


#### DNA Replication
* Goes form 5' to 3' 
* Helicase splits up the double helix
* DNA polymerase fills in the gaps of the DNA

There were three hypothesized models of DNA Replication
* `Conservative`: Original DNA molecule would remain intact and a new copy would be produced entirely from new molecules
* `Semi-Conservative`: Each strand of original DNA molecule serves as a template for the production of a complementary strand
* `Dispersive`: Fragments of the original DNA strand are interspersed with newly synthesized DNA in each daughter DNA molecule
* Semi-Conservative is the correct model

#### 10.2 The Cell Cycle
`Cell Cycle`: An ordered series of events involving cell growth and cell division that produces two new daughter cells
* Proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages of growth: `DNA replication`, `nuclear division`, `cytoplasmic division`

The cell cycle has two major phases `interphase` and the `mitotic phase`
* Interphase
	* The cell grows and DNA is replicated
* Mitotic phase
	* The replicated DNA and cytoplasmic contents are separated, and the cell cytoplasm is typically partitioned by a third process of the cell cycle called `cytokinesis`
