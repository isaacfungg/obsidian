#### Transcription
* Inside the `nucleus`
* `DNA` is used to make `mRNA`

Initiation
* `Promoter region` recognition site for `RNA Polymerase` to bind
* *Draw DNA with a section highlighted as the promoter region and a RNA Polymerase binding to it* **2:11**

Elongation 
* Binding causes the double helix to unwind
* The `RNA Polymerase` slides along the template DNA strand
* Polymerase links nucleotides to the 3' end of the growing RNA molecule
* *Draw RNA Polymerase unwinding double helix and messenger RNA forming* **2:41

Termination
* Once it reaches the Terminator region the transcript is complete

Messenger RNA
* Exons that code for a protein
* Non coding sections called introns
* Introns need to be removed 
* Leave the nucleus through a nuclear pore and enter the cytoplasm to begin translation


#### Translation
* The nitrogenous bases are grouped into three letter codes called codons
* Each amino acid is brought to the ribosome by a specific transfer RNA molecule
* Type of amino acid is determined by the anticodon


* Large ribosomal subunit forms the translation complex
* Peptide forms between its amino acid and the one attached to the transfer RNA molecule at the P site
