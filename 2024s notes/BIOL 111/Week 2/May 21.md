#### Characteristics of a living organism
* Organized
* Respond to external environments
* Grow and develop
* Reproduce
* Use and process energy
* Homeostasis

#### Endocytosis 
* Move into the cell materials that are too large

#### Exocytosis
* Send materials that are too large out of the cell

#### Use and process energy
* `Oxidiation`: The process of molecules losing electrons 
* `Reduction`: The process of molecules gaining electrons

#### ATP
* ATP are generated and used during both cellular respiration AND photosynthesis
* Initial breakdown of sugar takes place outside mitochondria but yields very few ATPs
* Further breakdown of sugar in mitochondria generates a lot more ATPs
* `Autotrophs`: Fix carbon, converting them into organic compounds
* `Heterotrophs` Eat autotrophs containing the fixed carbon

#### Grow and develop
* `Base`: Determines the identity of the nucleotide
* `Nucleotide`: Sugar + base + 1 to 3 phosphates
*
