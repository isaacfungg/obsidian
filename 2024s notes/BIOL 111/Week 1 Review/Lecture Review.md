#### Cell Theory
* All organisms are composed of one or more cells
* Cells are the basic structural and functional unit of all living organisms
* Cells only arise from pre-existing cells
#### Diffusion
* Rate of diffusion are determined by:
	* Distance the substance needs to travel
	* The surface area allowed for diffusion
#### Plasma Membrane
* Mostly made of phospholipids, cholesterol, and proteins

#### Basic structures of all cells
* Cell membrane
* Cytoplasm
* DNA
* Ribosomes

`Hypertonic`
* The solute concentration outside the cell is lower than inside the cell
* Water moves into the cell

`Hypertonic`
* The solute concentration outside the cell is higher than inside the cell
* Water moves out of the cell

#### Carbon Cycle
* `Autotrophs`
	* Fix carbon, converting them into organic compounds
* `Heterotrophs`
	* Eat autotrophs containing the fixed carbon
