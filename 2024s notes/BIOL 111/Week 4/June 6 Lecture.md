###### Darwin & Wallace's evolutionary theory
* Organisms are related by common ancestry and have changed over time through an evolutionary mechanism
* Variation among individuals  within species is important
* Natural selection was the mechanism by which species evolve over time

###### Evidence that species are related
* `Homologous traits`
	* Similarity between species that results from the inheritance of traits from a common ancestor
* 3 types of homology:
	* Structural
	* Developmental
	* Genetic

`Analogous traits`
* Arise due to convergent evolution
	* Independent solution to an environmental demand - not inherited from a common ancestor

`Point Mutations`
* A mutation that alters a single base pair of DNA
* Most point mutations are neutral
* Any mutation in the non-coding region is unlikely to affect the phenotype/fitness of an individual
	* Only 2% of DNA codes for proteins
* Two types
	* Base substitution
	* Base insertion or deletion
* Causes
	* Errors during DNA replication
	* Errors during the repair of DNA damaged by radiation or chemical mutagens

`Silent Substitutions`
* Point mutations that do not affect phenotype
`Fitness`
* Refers to the capability of an organism to produce viable offspring relative to others in the population
`Adaptation`
* Heritable traits that increase the fitness of individuals

#### Mutations
* Considered a weak evolutionary mechanism but is important for creating new genes
* Most mutations are silent/neutral (do not affect phenotype)
* Only affect one individual at a time
* Takes other evolutionary mechanisms (e.g. natural selection) to increase or decrease the new allele frequency in the population

#### Genetic Drift
* Process of random changes in allele frequency due to sampling error
* More pronounced in small populations
* Two mechanisms of genetic drift
	* `Population Bottleneck`
		* Population size decreases rapidly over a short period
		* This reduces the number and diversity of alleles that can pass to the next generation
	* `Founder Effect`
		* New population is founded by a few individuals
		* New population is isolated from the original population
		* Allele frequencies may be very different from the original population
	* Both mechanisms involve a change in population size
	* New populations are smaller than original population
	* Allele frequencies in new population differ from original population

#### Gene flow
* `Gene Flow`
	* The movement of alleles into or out of a population due to the movement of individuals between populations or the movement of gametes
* Can introduce new alleles into a population
* Tends to homogenize allele frequencies between populations

#### Darwin's Four Postulates
* Requirements
	* Variation
	* Heritable
	* Differences in fitness
* Four Postulates
	* Individuals within a species vary in their physical characteristics
	* Some of these variations are heritable passed on to offspring
	* More offspring are produced than can survive, leading to a struggle for survival
	* Individuals with traits better suited to the environment are more likely to survive and reproduce causing these traits to become more common over generations

#### Four modes of natural selection
1. `Directional Selection` (e.g. larger bodied individuals are selected for)
2. `Stabilizing Selection` (e.g. Human babies birth weights)
3. `Disruptive Selection` (e.g. individuals with more extreme phenotypes have higher fitness and are selected for)
4. `Balancing Selection` (e.g selective forces vary in different habitats of a population, or the fitness of different phenotypes are frequency-dependent)
