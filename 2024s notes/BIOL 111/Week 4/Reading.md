#### 18.1 Understanding Evolution
###### Processes and Patterns of Evolution
* Natural selection can only take place if there is variation, or differences, among individuals in a population
* Genetic diversity in a population comes from two main mechanisms: `mutation` and `sexual reproduction`
	* `Mutation`: A change in DNA, is the ultimate source of new alleles, or new genetic variation
	* `Sexual Reproduction`: When two parents reproduce, unique combinations of alleles assemble to produce the unique genotypes and thus phenotypes in each offspring
* `Adaptation`: A heritable trait that helps an organism's survival and reproduction in its present environment
* `Divergent Evolution`: Two species that evolve in diverse directions from a common point
* `Convergent Evolution`: Similar traits evolve independently in species that do not share a common ancestry

###### Evidence of Evolution
* Fossils provide solid evidence that organisms from the past are not the same as those today
* The presence of structures in organisms that share the same basic form
* `Homologous structures`: Evolution led to changes in the bones shapes and sizes different species, but they have maintained the same overall layout
* `Vestigal Structures`: Unused structures without function

###### Misconceptions of Evolution
* **Evolution is Just a Theory
	* In science, we understand a "theory" to be a body of thoroughly tested and verified explanations for a set of observations
	* In contrast, a "theory" in common vernacular is a word meaning a guess or suggested explanation
* **Individuals Evolve
	* Evolution is the change in a population's genetic composition over time, specifically over generations, resulting from differential reproduction of individuals with certain alleles.
* **Organisms Evolve on Purpose
	* Do not interpret the statement to mean that individual organisms evolve
	* Another is understanding is by interpreting the statement to mean that the evolution is somehow intentional


#### 19.1 Population Evolution
###### Population Genetics
* `Allele Frequency`: The rate at which a specific allele appears within a population
* `Natural Selection`: Beneficial alleles become more common leading to increased prevalence over time
* `Genetic Drift`: Random changes in allele frequencies that do not necessarily offer a survival advantage
* `Founder Effect`: Change in allele frequencies when a new population is established by a small number of individuals from a larger population
