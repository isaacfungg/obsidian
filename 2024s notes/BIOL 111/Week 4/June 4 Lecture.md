***
`Microevolution`
* Change in allele frequencies in a population in a relative short period of time
`Macroevolution`
* Evolution that occurs at or above the species level (longer periods of time)

###### Evidence that ALL species share a common ancestor
* All living taxa are made of cells
* Universality of DNA as the genetic code
* Universal flow of biological information, DNA to RNA to amino acids/proteins
* Near universality of the genetic code (codons) and DNA replication and repair
