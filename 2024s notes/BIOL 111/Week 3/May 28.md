#### Sexual and Asexual Reproduction
Sexual Reproduction
* Provides genetic variation
* Populations are more likely to survive in changing environments

Asexual Reproduction
* Time efficient
* Requires less energy 
* Not mate required
* Lack of genetic variation
* Populations can grow quickly and survive if the environment is stable

#### Sister chromatids and Homologous Chromosomes
* `Sister Chromatids`: The two identical chromosomes that result from DNA replication
	* Held together by a centromere
	* Have the same genes
	* Genes are at the same location
	* 2 Sister chromatids is considered one chromosome
* `Homologous Chromosomes`: A set of one paternal and one maternal chromosome that pair up with each other inside a cell during meiosis
	* Same size
	* Have the same genes
	* Can have different alleles

#### Haploid vs. Diploid
* `Haploid`: Has one set of chromosomes (only sperm and egg cells)
	* No homologous chromosomes
	* Gametes only
	* Formed by meiosis
* `Diploid`: Has two sets of chromosomes
	* Reproduce only by mitosis
	* No gametes
	* All somatic cells
	* Contains a pair of homologous chromosomes


* Gamete has one set of 23 chromosomes
* The union of gametes create a diploid cell called a zygote

#### Gametes
* `Gamete`: A reproductive cell that unites with another from the opposite sex to form a `zygote`
* Usually does not have the same number of chromosomes as the rest of the organism
* Differently sized between sexes
	* Female gametes are much larger (often fewer)
	* Male gametes are much smaller (often more numerous)
* 
#### Meiosis
* Produces gametes (sex cells)
