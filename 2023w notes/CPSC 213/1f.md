#### Dynamic Control Flow
Functions have addresses so we can make `pointers` to functions
**Useful for:**
* Polymorphism
* Generic operations
* Jump tables

`Function pointer`
* A **variable** that stores the **address** of a **procedure**
* Declaration: $<return-type> (*<var-name>)(<argument-list>)$;


#### Polymorphism
Invoking a method on an object in Java
* Variable that **stores** the object has a `static` type
* Object reference is dynamic, with `dynamic` type

#### Polymorphic dispatch
Target method address depends on the actual type of the referenced object
* Lookup of procedure address happens in runtime

Class Jump table
* Every class is represented by a class object
* Addresses of jump table is determined **dynamically
* Method's offset into jump table is determined **statically
