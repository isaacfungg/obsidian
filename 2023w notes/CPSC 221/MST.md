*** 
#### Prim's Algorithm
* Results in minimum spanning tree
* Starts with a single vertex and grows the MST from there by iteratively adding the smallest edge that connects a vertex in the MST
* If edge weights are distinct then it is unique

#### Kruskal's Algorithm
* Results in minimum spanning tree
* Sorts all edges by weight and iteratively adds the smallest edge that does not create a cycle in the MST

#### Dijkstra's Algorithm
* Shortest path from one node to every other node
* Choose the smallest path with an unclosed node
