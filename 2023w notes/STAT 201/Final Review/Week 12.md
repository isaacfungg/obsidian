`Between-group Variance`
* Calculated by comparing the mean of each group with the overall mean of the data
* Individual data points don't matter quite as much as just comparing group means

`Within-group Variance`
* Variation of each observation from its group mean

`Sum of squares`
* Numerical metric used to quantify them and this metric simply sums the distances of each point to the mean

`F-statistic`
* The ratio of the SS
* The test statistic for ANOVA
* Combined with the degrees of freedom to arrive at a **p-value**
* Small p-values come from large F-statistics
* Large F-statistics suggest that the between group variance is much larger than the within group variance
