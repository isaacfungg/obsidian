#### Learning Objectives
1. Compare and contrast quantitative and categorical variables
2. Explain random and representative sampling and how this can influence estimation
3. Define random variables and explain how they relate to sampling
4. Define standard error and explain its purpose
5. Compare and contrast population distribution, sample distribution and an estimator's sampling distribution
6. Explain what a sampling distribution is, list its properties, and its purpose in statistical inference

#### Definitions
`Population`
* The group containing all elements you want to study
* Is **unknown
`Population Distribution`
* Obtained by measuring all the elements in the population
* Is **unknown
`Parameters`
* Quantities that summarize the population
* Fixed but **unknown
`Random Sample`
* A subset of the population selected at random
* Changes every time you draw a sample
`Sample Distribution`
* Obtained by measuring all the elements in the sample
* The distribution of a statistic across **all possible** samples
* Is **known
* We hope that the sample distribution resembles the population distribution
* Things that affect the sampling distribution
	* Population
	* Sample size
	* Statistic
`Statistics`
* Quantities that summarize the sample
* Samples are random, so statistics are also random
* We use statistics to estimate unknown population parameters
`Independent sample`
* The selection of one element does not influence the selection of another
`Sampling with Replacement`
* Allows repeated elements in our sample
`Sampling without Replacement`
* Doesn't allow repeated elements in our sample
