#### Learning Objectives
1. Define type I & II errors
2. Describe the responsible use and reporting of p-values from hypothesis tests
3. Discuss how these errors are linked to a "reproducibility crisis"
4. Measure how these errors amplify when performing multiple hypothesis testing in the context of multiple comparisons

#### Types of errors
`Type 1 Error`
* Null hypothesis is true & reject null hypothesis
* Solve by making p-value smaller

`Type 2 Error`
* Alternative hypothesis is true & fail to reject null hypothesis
* Solve by making p-value larger
