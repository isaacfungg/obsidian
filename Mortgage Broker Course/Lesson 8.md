* It is not regarded as a separate legal entity and does not pay income taxes

#### Partnerships
Definition: A form of organization in which two or more persons carry on a business with a view to profit

#### Limited Partnership
Definition: Consists of one or more general partners and one or more limited partners

Limited Partners: Liability limited to their investment

All partners have limited liability, usually protected from each other's negligence or misconduct

Two main reasons for LLPs:
* Partners are accountable to their clients or customers
* Any partner may lose this limited liability and be held personally liable for the acts of another partner or an employee of the partnership if they had knowledge of these acts and failed to take reasonable actions to prevent them
#### Corporations
Definition: A business entity that is owned by shareholders who decide on the general policies of the company through their elected Board of Directors

The directors are primarily liable to the company rather than to the shareholders. The shareholders have no further responsibility for the company debts once the cost of their shares has been fully paid.
* This is why owners of small businesses frequently incorporate; if their company fails, their personal assets are not at risk

`Fair market value`: The price at which an informed buyer and seller would be willing to transact a trade of a given asset

**Matching principle** explains how expenses should be recorded in the same accounting period as the revenues they help generate

**Materiality Principle** is when only material (significant) financial information must be strictly accounted for. If an item is small and won't impact decision, simpler treatment is acceptable

**Objectivity Principle** is when all financial records must be based on objective, verifiable evidence and not opinions or estimates

**Consistency Principle** is once you choose an accounting method you should stick with it across periods
