#### Loan Administration and Management
`Rollover`: Practice where a borrower pays a nominal fee to the lender to postpone the maturity date of a loan

**Orderly Repayment
* Tasks:
	* Advance funds
	* Collect/report payments
	* Handle end-of-term payment, refinancing, or rollover
* Manage
	* Prepayment
	* Assignment if property is sold
	* Valuation or sale of the mortgage itself
**Default Situations
* Action needed when repayment is disrupted
* Requires judgement and skill to manage defaults and determine remedies
#### Loan Advance Before Contract Start
`Interest Adjustment Period`: The period of time between the date the funds are advanced and the beginning of the first payment period
`Financial (compounding) days`: Count either the start or end day, not both -> total days = calendar days - 1
**Daily Compounding**: Interest accrues each day; each day is a compounding period
**Two Standard Approaches**:
* Advance full amount early -> borrower pays interest for the adjustment period at contract start
* Advance reduced (discounted) amount -> it accrues interest to equal loan amount on start. date

#### Full Prepayment
**Monthly Interest Penalty Formula**
$$Monthly Interest Penalty = OSB * i_{mo} * Number of Months$$

**Interest Rate Differential Formula
$\text{IRD} = (\text{Contract Rate} - \text{Current Rate}) \times \text{Remaining Principal} \times \frac{\text{Months Left}}{12}$

#### Valuation of Mortgage Investments
`Book Value of a Mortgage`: Amount of principal outstanding at a particular point in time

#### Arrears and Default in Mortgage Lending
`Arrears`: Late Payments
`Default`: No payments being made

#### VRM
`Trigger Point`: The loan balance reaches a level where the outstanding principal + unpaid interest exceeds the original mortgage amount
`Trigger Rate`: The interest rate at which your fixed vrm payment is no longer enough to cover the portion of the loan

#### Graduated Payment Mortgages
* GPMs start with low monthly payments that increase over time
* Designed to match borrower's expected income growth, improving affordability
* Common in government-subsidized housing programs to help low/moderate-income buyers

#### Sinking Fund Assisted Mortgages
* SFAMs lower initial payments using a pre-funded sinking account, not by deferring interest
* Borrower receives less than the full loan; the withheld amount subsidizes early payments
* Unlike GPMs, loan balance doesn't grow due to unpaid interest risk is more transparent
* Managed subsidy reduces default risk, allowing somewhat higher loan-to-value or GDS ratio
