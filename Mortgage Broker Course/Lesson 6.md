#### Offers
An offer expires when:
* A time limit is specified in the offer and the offer is not accepted within the limit
* No limit is specified but a reasonable amount of time has passed
* The person who made the offer communicates revocation before acceptance
* A counter offer is made

#### When acceptance is communicated
An acceptance has no effect until communicated with the offeror.
Contracts are categorized in two types: those which can be accepted instantaneously and those where the parties expect the offer to be accepted by non-instantaneous means.

If the offeree doesn't follow the required method of acceptance, they risk the contract not forming-whether they respond too slowly or use a different method specified.

When the offer is intended to be accepted instantaneously the acceptance will not be complete until it has been received by the offeror. For example if A telephones B  with an offer and B accepts the offer but the line goes dead before then there is no binding contract.

On the other hand, if the offer is intended to be accepted non-instantaneously and gets lost in mail, there is still a binding contract as long as they can prove that they sent the mail.

#### Legal Intentions
Spoken agreements can form contracts, but only if the context shows serious legal intent - like a business deal and not a casual or personal promise.

With family or close friends, the court assumes there's no legal intent unless you have clear evidence like a written agreement, witnesses, or actions showing seriousness.

#### Capacity
Incapacity can prevent a valid contract from arising. The most common types of incapacity are infancy, insanity, drunkenness, and the lack of capacity at a corporation.
* Infancy
	* At law, a person younger than age 19 is considered a minor or infant
	* Most contracts to which a party is an infant are voidable by the infant
