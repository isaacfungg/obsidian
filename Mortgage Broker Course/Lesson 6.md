#### Offers
An offer expires when:
* A time limit is specified in the offer and the offer is not accepted within the limit
* No limit is specified but a reasonable amount of time has passed
* The person who made the offer communicates revocation before acceptance
* A counter offer is made

#### When acceptance is communicated
An acceptance has no effect until communicated with the offeror.
Contracts are categorized in two types: those which can be accepted instantaneously and those where the parties expect the offer to be accepted by non-instantaneous means.

If the offeree doesn't follow the required method of acceptance, they risk the contract not forming-whether they respond too slowly or use a different method specified.

When the offer is intended to be accepted instantaneously the acceptance will not be complete until it has been received by the offeror. For example if A telephones B  with an offer and B accepts the offer but the line goes dead before then there is no binding contract.

On the other hand, if the offer is intended to be accepted non-instantaneously and gets lost in mail, there is still a binding contract as long as they can prove that they sent the mail.

#### Legal Intentions
Spoken agreements can form contracts, but only if the context shows serious legal intent - like a business deal and not a casual or personal promise.

With family or close friends, the court assumes there's no legal intent unless you have clear evidence like a written agreement, witnesses, or actions showing seriousness.

#### Capacity
Incapacity can prevent a valid contract from arising. The most common types of incapacity are infancy, insanity, drunkenness, and the lack of capacity at a corporation.
* Infancy
	* At law, a person younger than age 19 is considered a minor or infant
	* Most contracts to which a party is an infant are voidable by the infant
	* It is however enforceable if another statute
* Mental Incapacity
	* The common law test for mental capacity to contract determines if a person can legally enter into a binding agreement. It has three parts:
		* They must understand the terms of the contract
		* Understand the effect on their interest
		* The other party must not know of the incapacity
* Foreigners and Illiterates
	* The rule is if they know the general nature of the contract then it is bound
	* They will also be bound if the neglect to find out the contents of the contract

#### Power of Attorney (POA)
A Power of Attorney is a legal document where someone (the donor) gives another person (the attorney) authority to make decisions on their behalf

**Regular POA**: Ends if the donor becomes mentally incapable or dies
**Enduring POA**: Remains valid even if the donor becomes incapable

If someone becomes incapable and they have no enduring power of attorney agreement in place the Supreme Court of Canada will appoint someone to make important decisions on their behalf.
In most cases, it'll be family or friend but in other cases a government body will make decisions on their behalf.
