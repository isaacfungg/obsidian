#### Subdivisions of Land
The creation of smaller parcels of land from a larger parcel of land.

Section 73 of the *Land Title Act* provides that a person must not subdivide land except in compliance with the *Land Title Act*.
Some are permitted including leases for less than 3 years

There are three different ways that land registered in the *Land Title Act* can be subdivided:
* An owner can do a "traditional", two dimensional subdivision (e.g., subdivide one lot into two lots)
* The owner could subdivide airspace (floors)
* The creation of a strata

#### The assurance Principle
Whenever legislation creates new rights for some people, it usually takes away existing rights from others

The assurance fund serves two purposes:
* **Compensation**: It compensates individuals who lose land or interests due to errors, omissions, or fraud in the registration process, ensuring they're not left disadvantaged by system flaws.
- **System Integrity**: It maintains trust in the land registration system by ensuring losses caused by administrative mistakes or misfeasance are remedied, upholding the system's reliability.
