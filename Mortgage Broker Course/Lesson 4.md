#### Subdivisions of Land
The creation of smaller parcels of land from a larger parcel of land.

Section 73 of the *Land Title Act* provides that a person must not subdivide land except in compliance with the *Land Title Act*.
Some are permitted including leases for less than 3 years

There are three different ways that land registered in the *Land Title Act* can be subdivided:
* An owner can do a "traditional", two dimensional subdivision (e.g., subdivide one lot into two lots)
* The owner could subdivide airspace (floors)
* The creation of a strata

#### The assurance Principle
Whenever legislation creates new rights for some people, it usually takes away existing rights from others

The assurance fund serves two purposes:
* **Compensation**: It compensates individuals who lose land or interests due to errors, omissions, or fraud in the registration process, ensuring they're not left disadvantaged by system flaws.
- **System Integrity**: It maintains trust in the land registration system by ensuring losses caused by administrative mistakes or misfeasance are remedied, upholding the system's reliability.

#### Torrens System
###### Key Features of the Torrens System
1. **Indefeasibility**: Registered titles are guaranteed by the state, and their accuracy cannot be challenged once registered.
2. **Simplification**: Eliminates the need for tracing back through historical documents to establish ownership.
3. **Public Registry**: Details of land ownership and interests are recorded in a publicly accessible system.
4. **Compensation**: Provides for a compensation fund to address losses caused by administrative errors or omissions.

###### Treatment of Trusts Under the Torrens System in British Columbia
1. **Trusts on Property Titles**:
    - Trust details cannot appear on the property title register.
    - Property can be registered under a trustee's or personal representative's name, but specifics of the trust itself are not entered into the register.
2. **Registration Details for Personal Representatives**:
    - When registering a property under a personal representative, additional details must be recorded:
        - Name and address of the personal representative.
        - An endorsement with necessary information to identify the estate of the deceased and a reference to the trust instrument.
#### Land Title Offices
There are seven land title districts in the province: Kamloops, Nelson, New Westminister, Prince George, Prince Rupe rt, Victoria and Vancouver

Administratively, the districts are distributed amongst three land title offices locates in New Westminister, Kamloops and Victoria

#### Searching Title
Title searches are crucial for individuals listing properties for sale, selling properties, arranging mortgage financing, or managing properties. They provide essential legal details about property ownership and encumbrances.

The most effective way to conduct a title search is by using the Parcel Identifier (PID), a unique nine-digit number assigned to each property by the registrar of land titles. This PID remains with the property unless it is subdivided or consolidated. 

You would also find a caveat while searching titles. A caveat only lasts for 2 months before it has to be renewed.

#### Builders Lien
Valid for a period of one year then the lien claimant must begin a lawsuit and file a CPL against title to the property in order to enforce its lien within this one-year period

#### Strata Corporation Finances
The strata corporation must have both an operating fund and a contingency reserve fund

The _Strata Property Act_ has rules that determine the minimum contributions to a strata corporation’s contingency reserve fund.

Strata corporations have several assets that may be used to secure loans, including real property, cash reserves, and accounts receivable


#### Strata Plan
Every plan must include the following:
* A unique registration number
* The boundaries of the land
* The location of any buildings
* A drawing distinguishing the strata lots from one another by numbers or letters in consecutive order
* The area of each strata lot in square meters
* Schedule of Unit Entitlement
* A schedule of Voting Rights if there is at lest one non-residential strata lot
* Any bylaws that differ in any respect from standard Bylaws
