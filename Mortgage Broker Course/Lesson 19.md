#### The Contract of Purchase and Sale
`Conveyancer`: A lawyer, notary, or their supervised assistant who prepares and manages the legal documents

The conveyancer will conduct the property search to ensure that the contract prepared by the real estate licensee is complete and accurate.

**Closing/Completion Date**: Legal transfer of title; buyer pays purchase price; seller transfers ownership
**Possession Date**: Buyer gets the right to physically move in

#### Survey
`Surveyor`: A professional who measures and maps land to determine property boundaries, size, shape, and features
