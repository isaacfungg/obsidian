###### Click to reveal the correct answer

**2. The Criminal Code**: This is the correct answer. Under the Criminal Code, charging interest above 35% annually is a criminal offence. This applies to all loans unless exempt. Sections 7 and 10 of the Interest Act apply to mortgages, not simple loans. The BPCPA applies to consumer protection and unconscionable lending, not criminal rates.
