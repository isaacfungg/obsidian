### Question 2
>[!question]
>- Which of the following statements about a strata corporation's finances is FALSE?
>
>1. The strata corporation must have both an operating fund and a contingency reserve fund.
>2. The Strata Property Act has rules that determine the minimum contributions to a strata corporation’s contingency reserve fund.
>3. Strata corporations have several assets that may be used to secure loans, including real property, cash reserves, and accounts receivable.

>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**(4) The contingency reserve fund is used to pay for expenses that usually occur less often than once per quarter**: This statement is FALSE. The contingency reserve fund is typically used for non-regular, larger, and often unexpected expenses rather than for those occurring regularly each quarter.

### Question 3
>[!question]
>- Which of the following properties could be converted into a strata development pursuant to the Strata Property Act?
>
>1. An existing apartment building with no strata plan currently filed.
>2. 10 acres of bare land with several buildings constructed upon the land.
>3. A newly created duplex with two separate entrances and separated living spaces.
>4. All of the above can be converted into strata developments.
>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**All of the above can be converted into strata developments**: Each scenario described meets the criteria under the Strata Property Act for potential conversion into a strata development, allowing for individual ownership and shared common property management.


### Question 4
>[!question]
>- Sharon, the registered fee simple owner of Whiteacre, sold her interest to Anne. Anne did not register the transfer she received from Sharon. Some months later, Sharon discovered that she was still the registered owner, so she "sold" the property again to Myron, who registered his transfer. Myron did not know about Anne's purchase and paid market value for the property. Anne has now discovered what has happened. Which of the following statements is TRUE?
>
>1. Anne is the rightful owner of the property and she can have Myron removed from the title.
>2. Although Anne cannot remove Myron from the title, she has a valid claim against the assurance fund.
>3. Myron's title is indefeasible because he purchased bona fide for value from the registered owner.
>4. Both (2) and (3) are true.
>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**Myron's title is indefeasible because he purchased bona fide for value from the registered owner**: This statement is TRUE. Since Myron was unaware of Anne's earlier transaction and he registered his purchase, his ownership is protected under the principles of indefeasibility, typical in property law frameworks that favor registered transactions over unregistered ones.

### Question 5
>[!question]
>- Three years ago, Bernard leased a warehouse from Harold for a 5-year term. Although Bernard was given a properly executed lease agreement, he failed to register it in the land title office. Which of the following statements is FALSE?
>
>1. Bernard's interest is protected in any event because there are only two years left on the lease. Therefore, it is a lease for less than 3 years and does not have to be registered.
>2. Harold is prohibited under section 20(1) of the Land Title Act from denying Bernard's leasehold interest on the grounds that the agreement was not registered.
>3. Bernard's interest is still valid as against Harold.
>4. Unregistered leases greater than 3 years in length are not protected from third party buyers.
>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**Bernard's interest is protected in any event because there are only two years left on the lease. Therefore, it is a lease for less than 3 years and does not have to be registered**: This statement is FALSE. Even though only two years remain on the lease, the initial term was for 5 years, requiring registration to protect the lease against third parties. Bernard’s failure to register does not alter the requirement based on the remaining term.

### Question 6
>[!question]
>- Which of the following statements about a caveat is TRUE?
>
>1. A caveat may be registered for up to three months without renewal to protect a claimed interest in land.
>2. A caveat is not of itself a cause of action or an interest in land.
>3. It is usual to register a certificate of pending litigation before a caveat.
>4. The use of a caveat is a good way to tie up any further dealing in land regardless of the validity of the underlying claim.
>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**A caveat is not of itself a cause of action or an interest in land**: This statement is TRUE. A caveat is merely a warning or notice to others that someone is claiming an interest—it does not itself create or prove the interest. A caveat only lasts for 2 months not 3.


### Question 7
>[!question]
>- Under the Land Title Act (the "Act"), registration:
>
>1. is not required by the Act for a conveyance of land to be enforceable between the parties to the transfer.
>2. is NOT necessary for leases for terms of greater than five years, as they are effective against all parties even if they are unregistered.
>3. renders a charge indefeasible.
>4. does not permit any indication of a trust on a registered title to land.
>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**1. is not required by the Act for a conveyance of land to be enforceable between the parties to the transfer**: This is TRUE. A conveyance is valid between the parties without registration, but it must be registered to protect the buyer’s interest against third parties.

### Question 8
>[!question]
>- In which of the following situations would someone have a successful claim against the assurance fund?
>
>1. Black owns Whiteacre. Mary forges a transfer to herself, registers it and then obtains a bank loan for $50,000 giving a mortgage of Whiteacre as security.
>2. Bob owns Blackacre which is worth $1 million. Martin forges a transfer to himself, registers it and then sells the property for $1.2 million to Jim who registers the property and is unaware of the fraud. Upon completion of the sale to Jim, Martin disappears and cannot be found.
>3. Gerald, the owner of Greenacres, gives a life estate in his property to his companion Jasmine. Subsequently, Jasmine sells her life estate to John. All necessary documents are registered in the land title office. In a fit of rage Gerald kills Jasmine to get his property back.
>4. In all of the above situations a successful claim against the assurance fund might be brought.
>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**2. Bob owns Blackacre... → Jim would have a successful claim**: Jim is a bona fide purchaser who registered title and suffered loss due to fraud. He can't recover from Martin (who disappeared), so he may claim compensation from the Assurance Fund.

### Question 9
>[!question]
>- A strata plan MUST show all of the following EXCEPT:
>
>1. a unique registration number.  
>2. the names of all of the registered owners of the strata lots.  
>3. the boundaries of the land.  
>4. the area of each strata lot in square meters.
>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**2. the names of all of the registered owners of the strata lots**: This is FALSE. A strata plan does **not** include the names of owners — it shows the layout, lot areas, boundaries, and other technical details, but **ownership info is handled separately** in land title records.

### Question 10
>[!question]
>- Kevin is the registered fee simple owner of Orangeacre. David forged a transfer of the fee simple from Kevin to himself and registered the transfer. David then approached ABC Trust Company and arranged a mortgage of Orangeacre. ABC advanced $100,000 to David and registered its mortgage against Orangeacre. Kevin has just discovered what has occurred. Which of the following is TRUE?
>
>1. Because David forged the transfer of the fee simple to himself, Kevin can have David removed from the title.  
>2. ABC is entitled to its mortgage because it dealt with the registered fee simple owner of Orangeacre.  
>3. ABC can successfully claim against the assurance fund for money to satisfy the mortgage.  
>4. All of the above
>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**1. Because David forged the transfer of the fee simple to himself, Kevin can have David removed from the title**: This is TRUE. A forged transfer is void, so Kevin never lost ownership, and the court can restore his title. ABC’s mortgage is not protected because it’s based on a fraudulent registration.

### Question 11
>[!question]
>- Which of the following statements correctly describes how the common property in a freehold strata development is owned?
>
>1. Each unit owner holds a proportionate fee simple interest in the common property as a tenant in common with the other unit owners.
>2. Each unit owner holds a share of the strata corporation which in turn owns a fee simple interest in the common property.
>3. Each unit owner holds a lease of the common property issued by the strata corporation and pays monthly maintenance fees to the strata corporation to fulfil their obligations under the lease.
>4. Each unit owner holds a license giving them the right to use and pass through the common property which is owned by the developer and managed through a strata corporation.
>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**1. Each unit owner holds a proportionate fee simple interest in the common property as a tenant in common with the other unit owners**: This is correct. In a freehold strata development, unit owners share ownership of the common property as **tenants in common**, with each owner holding an undivided proportionate interest.

### Question 12
>[!question]
>- What is the name of the table which sets out each strata lot owner's proportionate interest in the common property, and is used to calculate each strata lot owner's share of the strata corporation's expenses?
>
>1. Schedule of Voting Rights  
>2. Schedule of Strata Lot Ownership  
>3. Schedule of Unit Entitlement  
>4. Schedule of Strata Lot Titles  
>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**3. Schedule of Unit Entitlement**: This is the correct answer. The **Schedule of Unit Entitlement** outlines each owner's proportionate share of the common property and is used to calculate their share of the strata corporation’s expenses.


### Question 13
>[!question]
>- In a strata plan for a building, what is normally the boundary of each strata lot?
>
>1. The centre of each wall, floor, or ceiling that separates a particular strata lot from another strata lot  
>2. The inside surface of each wall, floor, or ceiling that separates a particular strata lot from another strata lot  
>3. The outside surface of each wall, floor, or ceiling that separates a particular strata lot from another strata lot  
>4. None of the above
>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**1. The centre of each wall, floor, or ceiling that separates a particular strata lot from another strata lot**: This is correct. In a strata plan, the boundary of each strata lot is typically defined as the **centre** of the dividing walls, floors, or ceilings, unless specified otherwise in the strata plan.

### Question 14
>[!question]
>- Which of the following statements regarding the right of mortgage lenders to vote at a strata meeting are TRUE?
>
>1. A lender is permitted to vote on any bylaw amendment or other issue at strata meetings in place of the unit owner by sending a representative to attend the meeting.
>2. A lender intending to vote at a strata meeting must give written notification to the strata corporation of their intention to vote at least three days before the meeting.
>3. A lender may, only if the mortgage document provides for this right, vote on issues of insurance, maintenance, finance or other matters affecting the security of the mortgage.
>4. A strata corporation is always required to send notices of annual or special general meetings to all mortgagees with charges on the titles of any strata lots in the strata development.
>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**B and C only**: These are true. A lender must give written notice to the strata corporation to vote (as per the mortgage agreement), and they can vote on specific issues affecting the security of their mortgage, such as insurance or maintenance.

### Question 15
>[!question]
>- Which of the following statements regarding depreciation reports is TRUE?
>
>1. A depreciation report must be obtained by a strata corporation every three years.
>2. Strata corporations are required to precisely follow the repair and maintenance schedule that is recommended by the qualified person who writes the depreciation report.

>4. If the results of a depreciation report are not favourable, the strata corporation may elect to make the most recent depreciation report unavailable for disclosure.
>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**3. A depreciation report may provide an indication that the assessment of a special levy on a strata unit will be likely in the near future**: This is true. Depreciation reports can help estimate future costs for repairs and maintenance, which may lead to the need for a special levy to cover these expenses.

### Question 16
>[!question]
>- Which of the following statements regarding the right of an individual shareholder to sell their shares in a cooperative corporation is TRUE?
>
>1. With few restrictions, an individual shareholder is free to sell their shares in a cooperative corporation to any party they so choose.

>3. The sale of shares in a cooperative corporation must be approved by the corporation's board of directors, which has wide discretion in determining to whom they will grant approval.  
>4. An individual shareholder is required to sell their shares to the next person listed on the waitlist at a price established by the cooperative corporation.
>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**3. The sale of shares in a cooperative corporation must be approved by the corporation's board of directors, which has wide discretion in determining to whom they will grant approval**: This is true. In most co-ops, the board must approve the buyer, and they have broad discretion in doing so — often based on financial stability or compatibility with the community.

### Question 17
>[!question]
>- Keith is the owner of a remote ocean-view mansion. He decides to go on a 3-year sailing trip around the world. He asks his neighbour Rob to take care of his property while he is away. Rob forges a transfer of the fee simple into his name and registers the transfer. Clark, not knowing of Rob's fraudulent activities, purchases the property from Rob for market value and registers the transfer.

>3. Keith will be able to recover title to the property, and Clark will not be able to get compensation from the assurance fund.  
>4. Clark will be able to retain title to the property, and Keith may be able to get compensation from the assurance fund.
>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**4. Clark will be able to retain title to the property, and Keith may be able to get compensation from the assurance fund**: This is correct. Under the Torrens system, Clark is a bona fide purchaser who registered the title in good faith. Even though Rob's transfer was forged, Clark's registered title is protected, and Keith may be eligible for compensation through the Assurance Fund.

>4. In any claim against the assurance fund, the BC Financial Services Authority must be named as a defendant in the action.
>

>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**2. In a pure Torrens system, no indication of a trust is permitted on the register**: This is TRUE. Under the Torrens system (as used in BC), the **existence** of a trust may be noted, but **no details** of the trust — such as terms or beneficiaries — are recorded on title.

>3. If a CPL has been registered on title, Mason may still register a transfer of the property to himself by attending the Land Title Office in person and making an oral declaration that he is aware of the CPL.  
>4. None of the above
>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**1. If it is found that Dolly's CPL was filed maliciously and with no legal basis, Dolly may be liable to George for damages**: This is TRUE. Filing a CPL without a legitimate legal claim can be considered an abuse of process, and the person filing it may be liable for any damages caused.
