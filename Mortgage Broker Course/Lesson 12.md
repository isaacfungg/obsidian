#### Residential Mortgage Underwriting
###### Five Cs of Credit
**Character**: Asses the borrower's reliability to repay, based on employment, stability, and background
**Capital**: Looks at how much personal money (down payment) the borrower is investing and their asset-building ability
**Capacity**: Evaluates whether the borrower can afford the loan using income and debt service ratios
**Credit**: Reviews the borrower's credit history and repayment habits via credit reports
**Collateral**: Refers to the property pledged as security in case of default

###### Pre-Approved Mortgages
When a prospective purchaser may choose to obtain a pre-qualification certificate from the mortgage lender, regardless of how certain the borrower is that they will qualify for a mortgage.

A pre-approved mortgage calculates the maximum loan for which the borrower qualifies. It also guarantees the borrower's interest rate for 60-120 days while the borrower looks for a property.

**Subprime Mortgages (aka "B" mortgages)
* Granted to a candidate who is considered to be high-risk due to being poor, limited credit rating, non-verifiable income, previous consumer proposal, bankruptcy.
* Usually classified as those where the borrower has a FICO score below 680

#### Types of Real Estate Value
**Purchase Price**: The negotiated sale price between buyer and seller reflects market conditions and negotiation
**Purchase Cost**: Total cost to buy the property - includes purchase price plus fees and any mortgage bonus
**Market Value**: Estimated price in a fair, arm's length sale under normal conditions based on comparable sales and market trends
**Lending Value**: Conservative, long-term estimate used by lenders- ignores short-term or speculative factors and is often less than or equal to market value

#### Loan to Value Ratio
Lenders limit the loan amount to a maximum of 100% of lending value which is equal to the property value.

For uninsured mortgage loans the maximum loan-to-value ratio is set by statute as 80% for federally chartered financial institutions.

Where mortgage insurance is available, either from private or government insurers, a loan-to-value ratio of up to 95% may be used.

`High-Ratio/Insured Mortgage`: When the loan-to-value ratio is more than 80%

#### Debt Service Ratios
###### Gross Debt Service Ratio
Defined as the ratio of the sum of the annual mortgage payments and real property taxes to annual gross income.
$$GDSR = \frac{P + I + T}{GI}$$
**P + I** represents the annual mortgage payment made by the borrower
**T** represents the property taxes made by the borrower
**GI** represents the annual gross income

A lender can also define GDSR to include heating cost and half of any condominium maintenance fees
$$GDSR = \frac{(P + I + T) + Heat + 1/2 Maintenance Fee}{GI}$$
###### Total Debt Service Ratio
The ratio of annual payment of all debts to annual gross income

$$TDSR = \frac{(P + I + T) + OtherPayments}{GI}$$
The maximum loan the lender would advance is the lesser of the amounts calculated with loan-to-value ratio and gross debt service ratio.


#### Adjustments to Financial Terms
Four basic financial elements are used to structure a loan: amount of the loan, amortization period, interest rate and payments.
###### Extending the Amortization Period
Without changing the gross debt service ratio, the amount borrowed can be increased by extending the amortization period.
###### Reducing the Contractual Term
Lenders are usually willing to offer borrowers a lower interest rate on borrowed funds if the loan contract is written for a short term (six months to three years) rather than a long term (three years or more) because reducing the time over which funds are committed improves lender's liquidity.

However, at the end of the term they may need to refinance and face the risk that interest rates have risen dramatically.
###### Adding a Second Mortgage
If lenders are unwilling to extend the amortization or reduce the contractual terms, borrowers may obtain additional funds by adding a second mortgage.

#### Stress Test
The OSFI stress test ensures borrowers can afford mortgage payments if interest rate rise. Lenders must assess affordability using the higher of 5.25% or the contract rate + 2%.
