`Insured Mortgage`: Where the lender is protected by mortgage insurance. It's required when the down payment is less than 20%.
#### Residential Mortgage Underwriting
###### Five Cs of Credit
**Character**: Asses the borrower's reliability to repay, based on employment, stability, and background
**Capital**: Looks at how much personal money (down payment) the borrower is investing and their asset-building ability
**Capacity**: Evaluates whether the borrower can afford the loan using income and debt service ratios
**Credit**: Reviews the borrower's credit history and repayment habits via credit reports
**Collateral**: Refers to the property pledged as security in case of default

###### Pre-Approved Mortgages
When a prospective purchaser may choose to obtain a pre-qualification certificate from the mortgage lender, regardless of how certain the borrower is that they will qualify for a mortgage.

A pre-approved mortgage calculates the maximum loan for which the borrower qualifies. It also guarantees the borrower's interest rate for 60-120 days while the borrower looks for a property.

#### Loan to Value Ratio
Lenders limit the loan amount to a maximum of 100% of lending value which is equal to the property value.

For uninsured mortgage loans the maximum loan-to-value ratio is set by statute as 80% for federally chartered financial institutions.

Where mortgage insurance is available, either from private or government insurers, a loan-to-value ratio of up to 95% may be used.
