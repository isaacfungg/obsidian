***
#### Definition of "Recent"
* Time just before appraisal date when supply & demand conditions are stable.
* Not fixed in weeks/months - depends on market stability; can be weeks to ~1 year

#### Definition of "Similar"
* Comparable properties need only be similar in factors that significantly influence buyers and prices
* Hard to identify & measure all market factors influencing price

#### Building Characteristics in Appraisal
**Design Similarity:**
* Focus on size, number of rooms, floor plan -> not just architectural style
* Style matters only if unattractive, unpopular, or highly attractive in market
* Use comparables of same design category
**Construction & Maintenance**:
* Quality & upkeep affect similarity but often less than appraisers might assume
* Modern buyers less sensitive to high-end materials vs. past generations
* Differences in construction cost may not equal differences in market value
**Equipment**:
* Includes built-ins, appliances, heating/cooling systems, pools, patios, lighting, bathroom fittings
* Differences are common; adjustments usually straightforward
**Age**:
* Affects design, construction quality, maintenance, and equipment
* Mortgage lenders may impose stricter terms for older homes, impacting market value

#### Lot Characteristics
**Location**: Unique and can't be duplicated; find lots with enough shared traits to be "similar"
**Natural features**: Soil quality, elevation, contours, streams, ravines, view
**Proximity to man-made amenities**: Stores, schools, parks, transport routes, employment
**Lot Size**: Determines building type possible

#### Title & Conditions of Sale in Appraisal
**Similarity requirement**: Comparable must match subject property in title and sale conditions.
**Financing adjustments**: Below market financing usually inflates price
**Special relationships**: Sales between related parties may not reflect open market value
**Neighbourhood effects**: If comparables are from same neighbourhood, tax assessments & public services match
**Services**: Gas, electricity, water drainage, garbage collection, roads - differences can significantly affect value

**Three point test for comparables**
* Recent sale?
* Lot & improvements similar?
* Title & sale conditions similar?

#### Adjustments for Value
**Goal**: Adjust sale prices of comparables to make them more similar to the subject property

#### Condominium Appraisal
Ownership includes fee simple interest in the unit + tenancy in common interest in common areas

**Value Difference Examples**
* Amenities: Variation in facilities affect value
* Hidden Differences: Extra unused property or liens/mortgages on common areas
* Charge Allocation: Basis may differ
* Included Costs: Some projects include utilities, others don't

#### Scope and Limitations of the Comparative Approach
**Advantages**
* Simple, direct, based on principle of substitution
* Reflects real buyer/seller behavior
* Works best when appraiser has strong market knowledge
**Limitations
* Not usable with insufficient market data
* Unique/infrequently sold properties
* Few sale due to economic conditions

#### Scope & Limitations of the Cost Approach
**Advantages
* When separate land/improvement values are needed
* For special-use properties with little market/comparison data
**Limitations**
* Hard to estimate incurable physical & functional depreciation
* Results harder to objectively verify compared to other approaches

#### Sources of Cost Data
* Residential -> cost per square foot
* Industrial -> cost per cubic foot

#### Age Life Method
`Physical Depreciation`: Loss in market value from physical wear & tear since construction
`Functional Depreciation`: Loss in value from outdated design/features that don't meet current market expectations even if still usable
`External Depreciation`: Value loss from factors outside the property, beyond owner's control
* % Depreciation = Effective Age / Economic life

Market Extraction
* Estimate land value, subtract from sale price -> improvement value
* Compare improvement value to replacement cost new -> depreciation amount
* Divide by age to get annual depreciation rate
* Average rates from several sales for market supported estimate

#### Breakdown Method
`Curable depreciation`: Physical or functional that can be corrected economically
`Incurable depreciation`: Physical or functional that cannot be corrected economically
Most detailed depreciation method
Breaks losses into three categories:
* Physical - Wear & tear, deterioration
* Functional - Outdated design/features
* External - Outside factors

`Reproduction Cost`: Cost to build an exact replica of the existing building
`Replacement Cost`: Cost to build a modern equivalent with the same utility, using current materials, design, and standard
