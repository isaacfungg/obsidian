#### Definition of "Recent"
* Time just before appraisal date when supply & demand conditions are stable.
* Not fixed in weeks/months - depends on market stability; can be weeks to ~1 year

#### Definition of "Similar"
* Comparable properties need only be similar in factors that significantly influence buyers and prices
* Hard to identify & measure all market factors influencing price

#### Building Characteristics in Appraisal
**Design Similarity:**
* Focus on size, number of rooms, floor plan -> not just architectural style
* Style matters only if unattractive, unpopular, or highly attractive in market
* Use comparables of same design category
**Construction & Maintenance**:
* Quality & upkeep affect similarity but often less than appraisers might assume
* Modern buyers less sensitive to high-end materials vs. past generations
* Differences in construction cost may not equal differences in market value
**Equipment**:
* Includes built-ins, appliances, heating/cooling systems, pools, patios, lighting, bathroom fittings
* Differences are common; adjustments usually straightforward
**Age**:
* Affects design, construction quality, maintenance, and equipment
* Mortgage lenders may impose stricter terms for older homes, impacting market value

#### Lot Characteristics
**Location**: Unique and can't be duplicated; find lots with enough shared traits to be "similar"
**Natural features**: Soil quality, elevation, contours, streams, ravines, view
**Proximity to man-made amenities**: Stores, schools, parks, transport routes, employment
**Lot Size**: Determines building type possible

#### Title & Conditions of Sale in Appraisal
**Similarity requirement**: Comparable must match subject property in title and sale conditions.
**Financing adjustments**: Below market financing usually inflates price
**Special relationships**: Sales between related parties may not reflect open market value
**Neighbourhood effects**: If comparables are from same neighbourhood, tax assessments & public services match
**Services**: Gas, electricity, water drainage, garbage collection, roads - differences can significantly affect value

**Three point test for comparables**
* Recent sale?
* Lot & improvements similar?
* Title & sale conditions similar?

#### Adjustments for Value
**Goal**: Adjust sale prices of comparables to make them more similar to the subject property
