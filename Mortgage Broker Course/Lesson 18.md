#### The Nature of Effective Negotiations
An effective negotiation is one that balances efficiency, satisfaction, resource use, and relationships

**Criteria for Success**
* Efficiency: Uses minimal necessary time/effort relative to importance of outcome
* Satisfaction: Both parties feel satisfied, even if agreement isn't reached
* No wasted resources: Maximizes total value; creative solutions ensure nothing valuable is unused
* Relationships: Preserves or strengthens relationships for future business/negotiations

#### Negotiation Approaches
**Distributive Approach**
* Views negotiation as conflict: one winner, one loser
* Zero-sum game: one's gain = other's loss
* Leads to compromise but limited outcomes

**Integrative Approach**
* Focus on interests & needs, not fixed positions
* Problem = opponent, not the other party
* Seeks creative solutions to satisfy both parties

###### What are the issues?
* List all possible issues
* More issues = more trade-offs, less zero-sum
###### What are the Interests?
`Position`: States stance/solution
`Interest`: Underlying reason/need
###### What are the priorities?
Ranking issues by importance for you/your client and for the other party

**Importance**
* True negotiation requires trade-offs
* Knowing real interest helps decide what's worth giving up

###### What are some possible solutions?
* Generate many potential solutions before negotiation.
* Avoid narrow thinking (splitting the difference). Negotiation isn't always a zero-sum game

###### What are your alternatives?
* Always identify your next best option if no deal is reached
* Strong alternatives = confidence, less desperation, more bargaining power
* Helps set your walk-away point

###### Know your resistance point
* Lowest acceptable outcome; below this = walk away to best alternative
* Prevents irrational/emotional decisions driven by ego, sunk costs, or competition

#### Exchange Principles
**Focus on Interests
* Focus on underlying interests, not fixed positions
**Packaging and Trading off
* Package multiple issues together instead of one-by-one
**Focus on Objective Standards**
* Agree on standards/principles before solutions
**Strategic Concessions
* Concessions should be reciprocal, not one sided

#### Communication Principles
**Revealing vs. Concealing Information
* Share less pertinent info first; build trust gradually
* Disclose reciprocally - match the other party's openness
**Role of Silence
* Silence allows listening, clarifying, and reflection
* Talking too much risks misunderstanding, disinterest, or over-disclosure
**Listen Actively**
* Focus on what's said, not your response
* Ask clarifying, non-critical questions

#### Relationship Principles
**Be Firm but Conciliatory
* Be clear and firm on interests, flexible on positions
* Stay polite, respectful, and avoid personal attacks
* Show concern for both parties needs
**Perspective Taking**
* Understand the other party's view without needing to agree
* Frame solutions consistent with their values to help them "save face"
* Use their perspective to craft win-win outcomes
**Know the Person and Context
* Consider personality, style, time, and cultural factors
* Be sensitive to values norms, and mood

#### Dirty Tactics
**False Authority**
* Clarify decision-making authority early
* Stay factual, calm, and non-personal
**Eleventh Hour Throw-In
* Expect last-minute demands
* Reopen negotiation and ask for something in return
**Deception
* Don't rely on trust alone - verify facts
* Use objective evidence or third-party confirmation
**Stress**
* Watch for undue pressure
* Suggest changes to reduce stress
**Negative Emotions
* Point out behaviour directly
* Call for a break until it stops
**Time is an Asset
* More time = more power in negotiations
* Avoid being rushed; use time strategically
**Post Settlements**
* Use initial deal as fallback, then share openly to seek improvements
* Only works with trust and motivation
**Anchoring Effect
* First number heavily influences negotiation
* Counter by ignoring anchor and using independent standards
* Use anchoring strategically when possible
