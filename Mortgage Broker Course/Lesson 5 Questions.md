**4. Assisting in the preparation and registration of mortgage documents on the advice of the lender, without confirmation from the registered owner of the secured property**: This is the correct answer. There is no requirement under the Criminal Code that confirmation from the registered owner be obtained simply to assist in preparing and registering mortgage documentation. The other options refer to actions that are specifically identified as offences under Sections 331, 385, and 387 of the Criminal Code.

### Question 2
>[!question]
>- James is a new submortgage broker. Harry approaches James to discuss options that might work for Harry to get financing to buy a home. Harry has poor credit and low income, and so James does not think Harry will qualify with an institutional lender. James tells Harry that he can qualify for a mortgage loan from a private lender. Harry asks James what his monthly payments would be with a private lender. James mistakenly looks at the wrong piece of paper and tells Harry the monthly payment for an institutional lender, rather than the much higher payment required for the private lender. Harry is thrilled and obtains a mortgage loan from a private lender, based on James' advice. Harry soon realizes that James was wrong about the required payments, and is unable to keep up with the payments. Which of the following causes of action can Harry MOST LIKELY succeed in against James?
>
>1. Fraudulent misrepresentation  
>2. Negligent misrepresentation  
>3. Mortgage fraud  
>4. Identity fraud

**2. Negligent misrepresentation**: This is correct. James made a false statement during the course of his business, without due care, and Harry reasonably relied on it to his detriment. The mistake was not intentional, so it does not amount to fraud, but it meets the test for negligence.


### Question 3
>[!question]
>- Which of the following describes an incident of identity fraud by Art?
>
>1. Art has created a fake letter of employment to indicate that he has a long employment history.  
>2. Art has fraudulently transferred title of a property into his name and is now attempting to secure a small mortgage on the property.  
>3. Art has artificially inflated the price of a piece of property using a false assessment, and is now attempting to sell to an unsuspecting purchaser.  
>4. Art has arranged for his girlfriend to answer her cell phone as his employer, and to confirm his employment record.
>
>**Answer Options:**  
>- A, B, and C only  
>- A and C only  
>- C only  
>- A, B, and D only
>

**A, B, and D only**: These actions involve **impersonation or falsified identity-related documents**, which fall under **identity fraud**. Statement C, however, involves manipulating the property's value, which is considered **value fraud**, not identity fraud.


### Question 4
>[!question]
>- Which of the following have contributed to the increase of mortgage fraud across North America?
>
>1. The increased frequency of mortgages being secured has created incentives to close deals more quickly.  
>2. Heightened levels of competition amongst mortgage providers.  
>3. Increased anonymity in the mortgage and home buying process.  
>4. The fact that mortgage fraud is not criminalized in Canada.
>
>**Answer Options:**  
>- B and D only  
>- A and C only  
>- A, B, and C only  
>- A, B, C, and D
>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**A, B, and C only**: These are contributing factors. Faster closings, lender competition, and anonymity reduce oversight and due diligence, making fraud easier. **D is false** — mortgage fraud *is* criminalized in Canada under the Criminal Code.

### Question 5
>[!question]
>- Eli was anxious to sell his house because he knew it was badly infested with termites, to the extent that the structural soundness was compromised. Sydney expressed an interest in buying the property but before making an offer, she asked Eli whether there were any problems she should know about. Eli, elated at the thought of getting the termite-infested home off his hands, assured Sydney that the structure was sound and free of any defects, and that Sydney did not even need to do a home inspection. Sydney subsequently bought the house and within one month discovered that the damage caused by the termites had seriously threatened its structural soundness, requiring thousands of dollars' worth of repair work. Which of the following statements is TRUE?
>
>1. Sydney may be able to sue Eli under both tort and contract law.  
>2. Eli cannot be held liable for his misrepresentation because he is not a professional real estate licensee or mortgage broker.  
>3. As there was no special relationship between Eli and Sydney giving rise to a duty of care, Eli cannot be held liable.  
>4. Sydney's remedies are limited to those provided for under contract law.
>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**1. Sydney may be able to sue Eli under both tort and contract law**: This is TRUE. Eli knowingly made a false statement, which may support a claim of **fraudulent misrepresentation** (a tort), and if that representation was part of the contract, it could also support a claim for **breach of contract**.

### Question 6
>[!question]
>- Interested in constructing a Piano Hall of Fame, Schroeder inspected a 10 acre piece of property which was listed for sale by the owner. After looking over the property, he sought the advice of his friend Lucy who is a registered mortgage broker with significant experience in development projects. Lucy stated that the area would be an excellent location for a tourist attraction, but advised Schroeder not to rely on her opinion, as she was unsure about the development restrictions applicable in the area. Without checking any further into the matter, Schroeder promptly bought the property for the express purpose of the building the Hall of Fame; he subsequently learned that the land was located within the agricultural land reserve, and therefore could not be developed for the purpose of a tourist attraction. Which of the following statements is TRUE?
>
>1. Lucy owed no duty of care to Schroeder because she was only giving advice as a friend  
>2. Lucy's qualification of her statement effectively released her from any liability.  
>3. Schroeder can successfully sue Lucy for negligent misrepresentation because she had a duty, as a professional, to take reasonable care that the information she supplied to him was correct  
>4. Schroeder cannot sue Lucy for negligent misrepresentation because there was no contractual relationship between them
>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**2. Lucy's qualification of her statement effectively released her from any liability**: This is TRUE. Lucy clearly stated that she wasn’t sure about the development restrictions and **advised Schroeder not to rely on her opinion**, which means she **disclaimed responsibility**, shielding her from liability for negligent misrepresentation.

### Question 7
>[!question]
>- Dermot owns a flower shop and his deliveries are made by his employee, Gus. While picking up fish and chips on his day off, to take home for his evening meal, Gus fell asleep at the wheel of his van and injured Molly. Which of the following statements correctly describes Molly's rights?
>
>1. Molly can sue Gus for breach of a fiduciary duty.  
>2. Molly can sue Dermot for Gus' negligence under the principle of vicarious liability.  
>3. Molly can sue only Gus in negligence because the accident occurred when Gus was performing an act outside the ordinary scope of his employment.  
>4. Dermot's liability in this scenario would change if Gus were an independent contractor.
>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**3. Molly can sue only Gus in negligence because the accident occurred when Gus was performing an act outside the ordinary scope of his employment**: This is correct. Vicarious liability only applies when the employee is acting within the scope of their employment. Since Gus was off-duty and running a personal errand, only he can be held liable for the accident.

### Question 8
>[!question]
>- Two designated individuals ("DIs") go out for lunch. The DIs operate the two most dominant brokerages in Campbell River and the surrounding area. The DIs are discussing how bad business has become recently. They begin to brainstorm ideas about how to improve things, and decide to make an agreement to not hire any new submortgage brokers. That way, they can each keep their own clients, and not have to worry about each other's new registrants stealing away business. Which of the following statements is MOST LIKELY to be true?
>
>1. This is an example of breach of fiduciary duty.  
>2. This is an example of value fraud.  
>3. This is an example of a breach of the Competition Act.  
>4. This is perfectly acceptable business behaviour.
>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**3. This is an example of a breach of the Competition Act**: This is correct. An agreement between competitors to restrict hiring or entry into the market is considered **anti-competitive conduct** and violates the **Competition Act**, specifically under provisions related to **agreements that limit competition**.

### Question 9
>[!question]
>- A fraudster buys a property from an arms' length purchaser for its market price: $500,000. The fraudster takes a mortgage loan of $200,000 from a bank for the purchase. The fraudster then enters into a purchase and sale agreement with a co-conspirator to sell the property for $1,000,000, which is double the true market value. The co-conspirator takes a loan of $600,000 from a second lender. The two fraudsters use $200,000 from the second loan to pay off the first loan, and disappear with the additional $400,000. What is this transaction an example of?
>
>1. Identity fraud  
>2. Value fraud  
>3. Negligent misrepresentation  
>4. Breach of fiduciary duty
>
###### Click to reveal the correct answer
**2. Value fraud**: This is correct. The fraud involved **inflating the property's value** to extract excess loan proceeds from a lender. Unlike identity fraud, which involves impersonation, this scheme is about **misrepresenting the property's worth** — a classic form of value fraud.
