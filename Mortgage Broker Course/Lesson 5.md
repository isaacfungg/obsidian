#### Negligence
Before a person will be held to be negligent, certain criteria must be met. The plaintiff must prove three things:
1. Duty of care – The defendant owed a legal duty to take care toward the plaintiff.
2. Breach of standard of care – The defendant failed to act as a reasonable person would under the circumstances.
3. Causation and non-remote damage** – The breach caused harm that was reasonably foreseeable (not too remote).
When a plaintiff can prove that the defendant owed them a duty of care which the defendant failed to fulfil, and that the failure of duty resulted in reasonably foreseeable damages, the plaintiff will succeed with a claim in negligence. If any one of the required elements is not proven by the plaintiff, the action in negligence will fail.

###### How Does Negligence Affect Mortgage Brokers?
**Normak Investments v. Belciug**:  
A mortgage broker passed on false info (property value, mortgage balance, income, assets) from a third party and borrower to a lender **without verifying it**. The lender relied on this info, loaned $70,000, and lost it all when the borrower defaulted. The court found the broker **negligent** for not verifying the information and ordered compensation.

#### Negligent Misrepresentation
The Supreme Court of Canada has stated the particular requirements for liability for negligent misrepresentation as follows:
1. There must be an untrue statement
2. It must have been made negligently
3. There must be a special relationship between plaintiff and defendant giving rise to a duty of care
4. there must be reasonable reliance by the plaintiff on the negligent statement
