#### Income/Investment Approach
Purpose: Values income-producing properties based on rental income

**Two Techniques**
* Direct Capitalization
* Discounted cash flow
**Direct Capitalization Steps**
* Calculate NOI
* Estimate market yield/return rate for similar investments
* Capitalize NOI at market yield to find market value

#### Establishing Net Operating Income
**Market Basis**: Use current market contract rents and yield rates from comparable properties with similar risk
**Best use**: Most accurate for rental income properties

**NOI Formula**
* Gross Potential revenue + other income - vacancy and bad debt allowance = **Gross realized revenue**
* **Gross realized revenue** - Operating expenses = NOI

#### Gross Potential Revenue
Definition: Total possible rent if fully rented at current market rates
Market Rent Basis: Compare similar properties; adjust for size, quality, location, amenities, tenant type
IC&I Tip: Identify below-market rents or reconfigurable spaces for higher income potential

**Lease Terms**
* Leasing fees = marketing/agent costs (not operating expenses)
* Leasing inducements reduce effective rent

**Other Income**
* Revenue from sources other than suit rents
* Examples: Garage or parking space rentals, laundry income

#### Vacancy & Bad Debt Allowance
**Definition**: Allowance for lost income from vacancies, tenant turnover, and unpaid rent
**Not an Operating Expense**: Deducted from gross potential revenue to get gross realized revenue
**Vacancy Rate Basis**: Use long-term vacancy rates from comparable buildings; adjust for trends
**Calculated As**: % of gross potential revenue

#### Operating Expenses
**Definition**: Only landlord-paid expenses; split into fixed and variable

**Fixed expenses**
* Property Taxes: Largest expense; based on assessment and tax rate
* Insurance: Covers fire, rent loss, water escape, liability; cost depends on building risk and reconstruction value
**Variable Expenses**
* Management fees
* Utilities
* Maintenance & repairs
* Cleaning/janitorial
* Grounds/parking maintenance
* Wages
* Garbage removal
* Decorating

#### Lease Consideration
**Applies to**: All income-producing properties
**Lease Types**:
* *Gross Lease*: Landlord pays all operating costs; rent fixed. Common in apartments, small offices, government leases
* *Net Lease*: Tenant pays base rent + share/all operating expenses
	* Single Net: Base rent + portion of expenses
	* Triple Net: Base rent + all expenses
	* Absolute Net: Tenant pays base rent + all expenses including structural

Multi-family: Typically gross lease; landlord covers heat, hot water, gas, common area electricity
Commercial/Industrial: Lease terms vary; long-term leases often shift most costs to tenant
