#### Income/Investment Approach
`Discount Rate`: The target yield an investor needs
Purpose: Values income-producing properties based on rental income

**Two Techniques**
* Direct Capitalization
* Discounted cash flow
**Direct Capitalization Steps**
* Calculate NOI
* Estimate market yield/return rate for similar investments
* Capitalize NOI at market yield to find market value

#### Establishing Net Operating Income
**Market Basis**: Use current market contract rents and yield rates from comparable properties with similar risk
**Best use**: Most accurate for rental income properties

**NOI Formula**
* Gross Potential revenue + other income - vacancy and bad debt allowance = **Gross realized revenue**
* **Gross realized revenue** - Operating expenses = NOI

#### Gross Potential Revenue
Definition: Total possible rent if fully rented at current market rates
Market Rent Basis: Compare similar properties; adjust for size, quality, location, amenities, tenant type
IC&I Tip: Identify below-market rents or reconfigurable spaces for higher income potential

**Lease Terms**
* Leasing fees = marketing/agent costs (not operating expenses)
* Leasing inducements reduce effective rent

**Other Income**
* Revenue from sources other than suit rents
* Examples: Garage or parking space rentals, laundry income

#### Vacancy & Bad Debt Allowance
**Definition**: Allowance for lost income from vacancies, tenant turnover, and unpaid rent
**Not an Operating Expense**: Deducted from gross potential revenue to get gross realized revenue
**Vacancy Rate Basis**: Use long-term vacancy rates from comparable buildings; adjust for trends
**Calculated As**: % of gross potential revenue

#### Operating Expenses
**Definition**: Only landlord-paid expenses; split into fixed and variable

**Fixed expenses**
* Property Taxes: Largest expense; based on assessment and tax rate
* Insurance: Covers fire, rent loss, water escape, liability; cost depends on building risk and reconstruction value
**Variable Expenses**
* Management fees
* Utilities
* Maintenance & repairs
* Cleaning/janitorial
* Grounds/parking maintenance
* Wages
* Garbage removal
* Decorating

#### Lease Consideration
`Escalator Clause`: Allows the landlord to recover expenses from the tenant should expenses increase. This is generally found in industrial and commercial leases
**Applies to**: All income-producing properties
**Lease Types**:
* *Gross Lease*: Landlord pays all operating costs; rent fixed. Common in apartments, small offices, government leases
* *Net Lease*: Tenant pays base rent + share/all operating expenses
	* Single Net: Base rent + portion of expenses
	* Triple Net: Base rent + all expenses
	* Absolute Net: Tenant pays base rent + all expenses including structural

Multi-family: Typically gross lease; landlord covers heat, hot water, gas, common area electricity
Commercial/Industrial: Lease terms vary; long-term leases often shift most costs to tenant

#### Items Omitted in Calculating Net Operating Income
Depreciation, capital cost allowance, income tax and debt repayments are omitted because they are specific to the individual owner or investor.

The appraiser is estimating market value, not value to the owner which is why they can't consider any items which may vary according to an owner's individual circumstance.

**Major Problems Associated with Estimates of Depreciation**
* The life of a building depends on its economic durability, not its physical durability
* The economic life of many buildings is so long that the amount of depreciation taken each year is negligible 
* There is no objective method of estimating the future economic life of a building and any estimate must be based on subjective opinion
* If depreciation is attributed to buildings, it could be argued that appreciation should be attributed to the value of the site

For these reasons, no depreciation allowance is made in appraisals using the investment or income approach

`Income Tax`: Since the rate at which individuals are taxed varies and, broadly speaking, all investments are liable to income tax on the same basis, income tax is not deducted in determining NOI
`Capital Cost Allowance`: Refers to the depreciation of assets, claimed for income tax purposes. Calculated according to the provisions of the *Income Tax Act*
`Debt Service`: Each project or property will have its own unique financing package. Appraisers can only consider net operating income before financing costs are included

#### Equity Yield
`Equity`: The total property value less all mortgage debts
Net operating income is not a return on the equity portion of the property's value

Mortgage debt is only considered in cases where the property is financed at a contract rate that differs from current mortgages rates

#### Required Rate of Return
**Risk**: The likelihood that his return and/or his original investment of money will increase, decrease or stay the same
**Management Requirement**: The amount of time and effort he must invest in order to receive a return and protect the money he has put into the property
**Liquidity**: The ease with which he can convert the asset to cash

#### Capitalization Process: Market Value
`Yield`: Return an investor expects to earn on the purchase of a property and is expressed as a percentage of the purchase price
`Capitalization Process`: The conversion of net operating income to a capital amount, such as market

To estimate the market value of an apartment building, the appraiser must establish:
* The net operating income the property will earn; and
* the return purchasers currently require in sales of similar properties with similar risk
After NOI is calculated, it is converted to market value, expressed as a capital sum

The essential ingredients for the derivation of market value using the income approach are:
* A realistic calculation of net operating income
* An accurate estimate of the appropriate yield purchasers are prepared to accept from a similar investment

#### Comparative Security of Real Estate Investments
Returns or yields from real estate investments must be competitive with other investment yields in the long run.
* People may prefer a higher return on real estate investments as it is less liquid and has a NOI which depends on many factors.
