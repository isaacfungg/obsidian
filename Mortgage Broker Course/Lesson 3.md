#### Easements
In order to constitute a valid easement, three requirements must be met:
1. **There must be Both a Dominant and a Servient Tenement
2. **The Easement Must Accommodate the Dominant Tenement
* The easement must increase the usefulness or value of the dominant property
3. **The Easement Must Be Capable of Forming the Subject-Matter of a Grant
* The easement must be clearly defined and legally enforceable

###### Creation of an easement
Easements may be granted for any length of time. However, an easement of a very short duration (e.g., six months) runs the risk of being classified as a licence.
###### Release of an easement
An easement may be released by an express agreement between the present owners of the dominant and servient tenements

#### Restrictive Covenants
There are five essential requirements that must be established before the courts will find that a restrictive covenant is valid and will run with the land:

1. **The covenant must be negative in nature
* The restriction must require the landowner not to do something

2. **The Covenant Must Benefit or Enhance the Value of the Covenantee's Land
* The restriction must provide a clear advantage to a specific piece of land

3. **Both the Dominant and Servient Land Must be Identified
* The covenant must clearly state which property is restricted and which property benefits

4. **The Covenant Must Have Been Intended to Bind Future Owners
* The restriction must be intended to apply to all future owners of the servient land

5. **The Purchaser of the Burdened Land Must have had Notice of the Covenant
* The covenant must be registered on title under BC's Torrens system so that any future buyers are legally aware of the restriction

###### Release of a restrictive covenant
A restrictive covenant may be released by an express agreement between the present owners or by court order pursuant to section 35 of the Property Law Act.

#### Building Schemes
They must meet three basic requirements to be registrable:

1. **The Obligations Must Be Negative in Nature
* The restrictions must prevent owners from doing something

2. **There Must Be Both Benefited and Burdened Land
* The building scheme must define which properties are subject to the restrictions

3. **The Title to the Affected Land Must Be Registered Under the Land Title Act
* The building scheme must be registered on title to ensure future owners are legally bound by the restrictions

###### Release of a building scheme
The restrictions may be modified or discharged by an express agreement between all of the current owners of the lots subject to the scheme
