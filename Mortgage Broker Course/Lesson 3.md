#### Easements (Runs with the Land)
In order to constitute a valid easement, three requirements must be met:
1. **There must be Both a Dominant and a Servient Tenement
2. **The Easement Must Accommodate the Dominant Tenement
* The easement must increase the usefulness or value of the dominant property
3. **The Easement Must Be Capable of Forming the Subject-Matter of a Grant
* The easement must be clearly defined and legally enforceable

###### Creation of an easement
Easements may be granted for any length of time. However, an easement of a very short duration (e.g., six months) runs the risk of being classified as a licence.
###### Release of an easement
An easement may be released by an express agreement between the present owners of the dominant and servient tenements
***
#### Restrictive Covenants (Runs with the Land)
There are five essential requirements that must be established before the courts will find that a restrictive covenant is valid and will run with the land:

1. **The covenant must be negative in nature
* The restriction must require the landowner not to do something
* They can be positive in nature but does not run with the land

2. **The Covenant Must Benefit or Enhance the Value of the Covenantee's Land
* The restriction must provide a clear advantage to a specific piece of land

3. **Both the Dominant and Servient Land Must be Identified
* The covenant must clearly state which property is restricted and which property benefits

4. **The Covenant Must Have Been Intended to Bind Future Owners
* The restriction must be intended to apply to all future owners of the servient land

5. **The Purchaser of the Burdened Land Must have had Notice of the Covenant
* The covenant must be registered on title under BC's Torrens system so that any future buyers are legally aware of the restriction

###### Release of a restrictive covenant
A restrictive covenant may be released by an express agreement between the present owners or by court order pursuant to section 35 of the Property Law Act.
***
#### Building Schemes
They must meet three basic requirements to be registrable:

1. **The Obligations Must Be Negative in Nature
* The restrictions must prevent owners from doing something

2. **There Must Be Both Benefited and Burdened Land
* The building scheme must define which properties are subject to the restrictions

3. **The Title to the Affected Land Must Be Registered Under the Land Title Act
* The building scheme must be registered on title to ensure future owners are legally bound by the restrictions

###### Common Seller Rule
All original buyers must purchase their lots from the same seller
###### Release of a building scheme
The restrictions may be modified or discharged by an express agreement between all of the current owners of the lots subject to the scheme
***

#### Property Law Act
Provides legal mechanisms for modifying or canceling certain interests in land, such as easements, statutory rights of ways, statutory building schemes, and restrictive covenants

A person can apply to the BC Supreme Court to cancel or modify registered interests in land

***

#### Joint Tenancy
Joint tenants cannot pass their share through a will because when one owner dies, their share automatically transfers to the surviving joint tenants.

At common law, four "unities" had to exist and be maintained in order to create a joint tenancy and to have it continue:
###### **Unity of Time**
All Joint tenants must acquire their interest at the same time
* If an owner is added later, it breaks the joint tenancy
###### **Unity of Title**
All joint tenants must acquire ownership through the same legal document
* If one owner has a different source of title, it breaks joint tenancy
###### **Unity of Interest**
Each joint tenant must have an equal share in the property
* If shares are unequal, it breaks joint tenancy
###### **Unity of Possession**
Each joint tenant has equal rights to possess and use the entire property
* No owner can exclude another from any part of the property

###### Termination of a Joint Tenancy
1. Sale or Transfer of interest
2. Mutual Agreement
3. Partition

If someone sells their interest the previous joint tenants will remain joint tenants but the buyer will be tenant in common.
***
#### Tenancy in Common
Since there is no right of survivorship, a tenant in common may leave their interest by will to whomever they wish

A transfer of a deceased joint tenant's estate or interest into the name of the surviving joint tenant is a simpler procedure than the transfer to an heir when a tenant in common dies
###### Termination of a Tenancy in Common
1. Sale or Transfer of All Shares to One Owner (Merger)
2. Partition (Court-Ordered or Voluntary Division)

***

#### Tort Law

**Negligence**: Failing to take reasonable care
**Trespass**: Entering someone's land without permission
**Nuisance**: Unreasonable use of land that interferes with neighbours
