#### Standard vs. Collateral Charge Mortgages
###### **Standard Charge**
* Registered for the exact loan amount
* Terms (interest, payments) are listed on title
* Easier to transfer to another lender
* Need a new registration for future borrowing
* Discharged when loan is paid off
* Registered at the Land Title Office with all key loan terms

###### **Collateral Charge
* Registered for more than the loan amount 
* Terms are in separate loan documents, not on title
* Harder to transfer to another lender
* Can use credit cards and other things for security
* Allows additional borrowing without re-registering
* May stay on title even after loan is repaid
