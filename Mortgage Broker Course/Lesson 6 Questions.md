### Question 1

> [!question]  
> Francis recently immigrated to British Columbia and decided to buy a condominium. Because Francis does not speak or read English, his English-speaking brother comes along with him to translate. Francis decides to make an offer on a False Creek strata unit he really likes. He asks his brother where on the document he should sign the contract of purchase and sale. His brother points to the spot and Francis signs and later delivers the properly executed offer to the vendor along with the deposit. At no time does his brother or anyone else read the document to him. The vendor accepts his offer by signing it. Two weeks later, Francis discovers he is bound by the contract and is shocked. He thought the contract he signed was merely part of on-going negotiations. He demands a return of his deposit. Which of the following is a TRUE statement of Francis' legal position?
> 
> 1. Because of his inability to understand English, Francis did not have the legal capacity to enter a contract. He is therefore not bound by the agreement.
>     
> 2. Francis neglected to find out the contents and true nature of the contract he signed. He is bound by the contract and if he cannot complete he may forfeit his deposit.
>     
> 3. Because Francis has demanded the return of his deposit there is no consideration. Because there was no consideration a contract cannot be said to be formed.
>     
> 4. Because Francis did not understand the contract, the offer was not made in clear and unambiguous terms. The contract is therefore voidable at Francis' option and he should get his deposit back.
>

**2. Francis neglected to find out the contents and true nature of the contract he signed. He is bound by the contract and if he cannot complete he may forfeit his deposit**: This is the correct answer. The contract was properly executed, and Francis had the responsibility to ensure he understood it. His language barrier does not excuse him from being bound. The other options misinterpret capacity, consideration, and contract clarity.

### Question 2

> [!question]  
> A journalist visited the house of an art collector to study the collector's various paintings. The journalist later published a book on the collection, praising the collection as truly one of a kind. Flattered by this review, the art collector phoned the journalist and said, "In exchange for your kind words, I shall give you any piece from my collection that you wish". When the journalist arrived at the collector's house to claim the art promised to him, the art collector's husband refused to let the journalist take anything from the collector's collection. The journalist plans to sue the art collector for breach of contract. Which of the following statements is TRUE?
> 
> 1. Where the parties have not set a monetary value to the consideration for a contract, a court will not enforce the contract.
>     
> 2. The promise of art from the art collector's collection was not given in exchange for the praise published within the journalist's book. The praise occurred before the promise of artwork, and is thus considered past consideration; therefore, it cannot support a binding contract.
>     
> 3. When the art collector told the journalist that he could have a piece of art in exchange for his publication of a book on the collection, those mutual promises formed a binding contract.
>     
> 4. Because the art collector's promise was made orally, she and the journalist have not entered into a legally binding contract.
>     

###### Click to reveal the correct answer

**2. The promise of art from the art collector's collection was not given in exchange for the praise published within the journalist's book. The praise occurred before the promise of artwork, and is thus considered past consideration; therefore, it cannot support a binding contract**: This is the correct answer. Past consideration is not valid for forming a binding contract. The promise was made **after** the journalist’s performance, so no enforceable contract exists.

### Question 3

> [!question]  
> George and Jason executed a contract under seal. Because of the seal:
> 
> 1. the postal acceptance rule applies.
>     
> 2. consideration is not required
>     
> 3. they do not need to have the legal intention to contract.
>     
> 4. the contract is void.
>     

###### Click to reveal the correct answer

**2. consideration is not required**: This is the correct answer. A contract under seal is binding even without consideration. The seal shows serious intent to be bound. The other options are incorrect: the postal rule applies regardless of a seal, legal intention is still required, and a seal doesn’t make a contract void.

### Question 4

> [!question]  
> Angela was talking to Moira in a cafe and offered to sell her two-year-old car to Moira for the very low price of $7,000. Moira said that she wasn't certain whether she wanted to buy the car and that she would think about it. Hector, who was eavesdropping on the women's conversation, spoke up to say "You've got a deal! I'll buy your car for that price". Angela replied that she did not want to sell the car to Hector. Hector insisted that they had a contract. Angela felt that she was obligated to sell the car to Moira, if she did decide she wanted to purchase it.
> 
> Which of the following statements is TRUE?
> 
> 1. Angela is not required to agree to sell her car to Hector for $7,000.
>     
> 2. At this point Moira and Angela have made a contract for the sale of the car.
>     
> 3. If Angela accepts Hector's offer she will be liable to Moira for damages for breach of contract.
>     
> 4. Angela is not free to sell the car to anyone else unless she actually receives Moira's rejection of her offer.
>     

###### Click to reveal the correct answer

**1. Angela is not required to agree to sell her car to Hector for $7,000**: This is the correct answer. Angela made an offer to Moira, not Hector. Since Hector was not the intended offeree, he cannot accept the offer. No contract exists between Angela and Hector, or Angela and Moira.

### Question 5

> [!question]  
> On Monday, Peter mailed an offer to Beth to buy her horse for a price of $400. The offer was stated to be open for acceptance until 9:00 a.m. on Friday. It also stated, "Reply by telephone". Beth considered the offer, and decided to accept. However, she wanted all dealings to be in writing, so she wrote a letter of acceptance and mailed it on Thursday morning at 10:00 a.m. On Thursday afternoon, Peter found a better horse and telephoned Beth and told her that he was revoking his offer. Beth's letter of acceptance arrived at 8:00 a.m. Friday morning. One or more of the following statements may be true.
> 
> A. Since Beth mailed her acceptance prior to Friday morning at 9:00 a.m., she has a valid contract with Peter.  
> B. Since Beth's letter of acceptance was received by 9:00 a.m. on Friday, she has a valid contract with Peter.  
> C. Since Peter revoked his offer prior to Beth communicating her acceptance there is no contract.  
> D. Since Peter's offer was sent by mail, he was not legally entitled to require Beth to reply by telephone.
> 
> Which statement(s) is/are TRUE?
> 
> 1. A and D only
>     
> 2. B only
>     
> 3. C only
>     
> 4. None of the above
>     

###### Click to reveal the correct answer

**3. C only**: This is the correct answer. Because Peter required acceptance by telephone, Beth's mailed response was not valid acceptance. Peter revoked the offer before acceptance was properly communicated, so no contract was formed. The postal acceptance rule doesn’t apply when the offer specifies another method.

### Question 6

> [!question]  
> Ranjit and Ab enter into a contract with Ivan, under which Ranjit and Ab agree to paint the exterior of Ivan's house by October 31 for a price of $5,000. Which one of the following incidents would terminate the contract?
> 
> 1. After seeing the completed job, Ivan thinks the colour of the paint he agreed to looks too bright in such large quantities on his house.
>     
> 2. On October 13, Ranjit and Ab ask Ivan if they can have an extension of 2 days beyond the completion date, which would enable them to enter into another contract with one of Ivan's neighbours.
>     
> 3. Ranjit and Ab complete the job on October 20, and Ivan pays them the agreed price.
>     
> 4. On October 18, Ivan sells his house to Juan, agreeing to complete the sale on December 11.
>     

###### Click to reveal the correct answer

**3. Ranjit and Ab complete the job on October 20, and Ivan pays them the agreed price**: This is the correct answer. A contract is terminated when both parties fully perform their obligations. The other scenarios involve dissatisfaction, a request for an extension, or a future house sale — none of which automatically end the contract.

### Question 7

> [!question]  
> Harry orally offered to give Mary a one-hour piano lesson for $25. Which of the following statements is TRUE?
> 
> 1. If Susan overhears Harry's offer, and Mary is not interested in accepting, Susan can accept.
>     
> 2. If Mary accepts, and Harry does not honour the contract, Mary cannot successfully sue Harry because the contract was not in writing.
>     
> 3. If Harry did not specify a time limit for acceptance, Mary can accept at any future date.
>     
> 4. None of the above
>     

###### Click to reveal the correct answer

**4. None of the above**: This is the correct answer.

- Option 1 is false because only the intended offeree (Mary) can accept the offer.
    
- Option 2 is false because oral contracts are generally enforceable unless the law requires writing.
    
- Option 3 is false because offers without a stated time limit must still be accepted within a **reasonable time**.

### Question 8

> [!question]  
> Which of the following statements regarding conditions in a contract of purchase and sale are TRUE?
> 
> A. A condition is a promise which is not fundamental to the contract.  
> B. In most cases, the breach of a condition permits the innocent party to terminate the contract.  
> C. A "time is of the essence" clause indicates that timely performance is a condition of the contract.  
> D. If a term is not a condition, then a breach of that term will not result in any remedies for the innocent party.
> 
> 1. A and C only
>     
> 2. A and D only
>     
> 3. C and D only
>     
> 4. B and C only
>     

###### Click to reveal the correct answer

**4. B and C only**: This is the correct answer. A condition is a **fundamental** term of a contract, and its breach typically allows the innocent party to terminate. A “time is of the essence” clause makes timely performance a **condition**. Statements A and D are false because conditions are fundamental, and even breach of non-conditions (like warranties) can still lead to remedies.
