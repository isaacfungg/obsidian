### Question 1

> [!question]  
> Francis recently immigrated to British Columbia and decided to buy a condominium. Because Francis does not speak or read English, his English-speaking brother comes along with him to translate. Francis decides to make an offer on a False Creek strata unit he really likes. He asks his brother where on the document he should sign the contract of purchase and sale. His brother points to the spot and Francis signs and later delivers the properly executed offer to the vendor along with the deposit. At no time does his brother or anyone else read the document to him. The vendor accepts his offer by signing it. Two weeks later, Francis discovers he is bound by the contract and is shocked. He thought the contract he signed was merely part of on-going negotiations. He demands a return of his deposit. Which of the following is a TRUE statement of Francis' legal position?
> 
> 1. Because of his inability to understand English, Francis did not have the legal capacity to enter a contract. He is therefore not bound by the agreement.
>     
> 2. Francis neglected to find out the contents and true nature of the contract he signed. He is bound by the contract and if he cannot complete he may forfeit his deposit.
>     
> 3. Because Francis has demanded the return of his deposit there is no consideration. Because there was no consideration a contract cannot be said to be formed.
>     
> 4. Because Francis did not understand the contract, the offer was not made in clear and unambiguous terms. The contract is therefore voidable at Francis' option and he should get his deposit back.

**2. Francis neglected to find out the contents and true nature of the contract he signed. He is bound by the contract and if he cannot complete he may forfeit his deposit**: This is the correct answer. The contract was properly executed, and Francis had the responsibility to ensure he understood it. His language barrier does not excuse him from being bound. The other options misinterpret capacity, consideration, and contract clarity.

### Question 2

> [!question]  
> A journalist visited the house of an art collector to study the collector's various paintings. The journalist later published a book on the collection, praising the collection as truly one of a kind. Flattered by this review, the art collector phoned the journalist and said, "In exchange for your kind words, I shall give you any piece from my collection that you wish". When the journalist arrived at the collector's house to claim the art promised to him, the art collector's husband refused to let the journalist take anything from the collector's collection. The journalist plans to sue the art collector for breach of contract. Which of the following statements is TRUE?
> 
> 1. Where the parties have not set a monetary value to the consideration for a contract, a court will not enforce the contract.
>     
> 2. The promise of art from the art collector's collection was not given in exchange for the praise published within the journalist's book. The praise occurred before the promise of artwork, and is thus considered past consideration; therefore, it cannot support a binding contract.
>     
> 3. When the art collector told the journalist that he could have a piece of art in exchange for his publication of a book on the collection, those mutual promises formed a binding contract.
>     
> 4. Because the art collector's promise was made orally, she and the journalist have not entered into a legally binding contract.
>

**2. The promise of art from the art collector's collection was not given in exchange for the praise published within the journalist's book. The praise occurred before the promise of artwork, and is thus considered past consideration; therefore, it cannot support a binding contract**: This is the correct answer. Past consideration is not valid for forming a binding contract. The promise was made **after** the journalist’s performance, so no enforceable contract exists.

### Question 3

> [!question]  
> George and Jason executed a contract under seal. Because of the seal:
> 
> 1. the postal acceptance rule applies.
>     
> 2. consideration is not required
>     
> 3. they do not need to have the legal intention to contract.
>     
> 4. the contract is void.
>     

###### Click to reveal the correct answer

**2. consideration is not required**: This is the correct answer. A contract under seal is binding even without consideration. The seal shows serious intent to be bound. The other options are incorrect: the postal rule applies regardless of a seal, legal intention is still required, and a seal doesn’t make a contract void.
