`Appraiser`: One who is expected to perform valuation services
`Appraisal`: An estimate of the value in real property

#### Needs for Appraisal
`Externality`: Factor separate from the property can affect the property's value
###### Reasons for limited data
* Low turnover rate - few sales = limited comparable data
* Uniqueness - every parcel differs; values can't be easily standardized
* Durability - property lasts long, slower to respond to market changes
* Local markets - location fixed; affected by nearby properties
#### The Appraisal Process
`Cost Principle`: A financial reporting principle requiring that asset value be recorded at its historic cost of acquisition
`Investment value`: The worth of a property to a particular investor
`Legal Interests in Real Estate`: The legal rights of ownership vested in a particular piece of real estate
###### Step 1: Defining the Appraisal Problem
The first step in the appraisal process is to clarify what is to be appraised and why

Factors Influencing Market Value
* **Economic**: trends in commerce and industry, interest rates, unemployment rates, wage levels, availability of money and credit, price levels, tax burdens, etc
* **Political/government**: zoning bylaws, building codes, fire regulations, public health measures, rent controls, monetary policies including all forms of taxation, legislation, political upheaval or stability, government housing programs
* **Social**: population growth/decline, shifts in population density, changes in the size of families, desire for recreation/education facilities and neighbourhood amenities, desire for privacy, pride leading to ostentation and show in expensive homes
* **Physical**: created either by nature or by people including topography, soil fertility, climate, location, flood control, soil conservation, and community factors such as transportation, schools, churches, parks, and recreation areas

Date of valuation is important since value can fluctuate over reasonably short periods of time
