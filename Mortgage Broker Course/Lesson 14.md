`Appraiser`: One who is expected to perform valuation services
`Appraisal`: An estimate of the value in real property

#### Needs for Appraisal
`Externality`: Factor separate from the property can affect the property's value
###### Reasons for limited data
* Low turnover rate - few sales = limited comparable data
* Uniqueness - every parcel differs; values can't be easily standardized
* Durability - property lasts long, slower to respond to market changes
* Local markets - location fixed; affected by nearby properties
#### The Appraisal Process
`Subject of an appraisal`: The specific real estate and the legal rights of ownership or interest in that real estate that are being valued
`Cost Principle`: A financial reporting principle requiring that asset value be recorded at its historic cost of acquisition
`Investment value`: The worth of a property to a particular investor
`Legal Interests in Real Estate`: The legal rights of ownership vested in a particular piece of real estate
###### Step 1: Defining the Appraisal Problem
The first step in the appraisal process is to clarify what is to be appraised and why

Factors Influencing Market Value
* **Economic**: trends in commerce and industry, interest rates, unemployment rates, wage levels, availability of money and credit, price levels, tax burdens, etc
* **Political/government**: zoning bylaws, building codes, fire regulations, public health measures, rent controls, monetary policies including all forms of taxation, legislation, political upheaval or stability, government housing programs
* **Social**: population growth/decline, shifts in population density, changes in the size of families, desire for recreation/education facilities and neighbourhood amenities, desire for privacy, pride leading to ostentation and show in expensive homes
* **Physical**: created either by nature or by people including topography, soil fertility, climate, location, flood control, soil conservation, and community factors such as transportation, schools, churches, parks, and recreation areas

Date of valuation is important since value can fluctuate over reasonably short periods of time

###### Step 2: Scope of Work Determination
`Scope of work`: The amount and type of information researched and the analysis applied in the valuation assignment

Set the boundaries for how much research, inspection, and analysis will be done so the valuation is credible for its intended use, and to clearly state any limitations so no one is misled.
* Ensures the appraiser/s work meets legal duties and standard of care
* Matches the level of due diligence to the client's needs and budget
* Protects the appraiser by documenting what was and wasn't done.

###### Step 3: Data Collection
Gather all info needed to appraise the property's value after defining the problem & scope.

**Types of Data**
* General Data
	* Social, economic, political, and physical factors at country, province, municipality, and neighbourhood levels
* Specific Data
	* Details about the property itself and the rights attached to it

**General Economic Factors**
Broad economic conditions shaping the environment in which real estate markets operate

Examples: Inflation, unemployment, interest rates, exchange rates, government policies, political stability
Usually less important for short-term appraisals because they change slowly

**Regional Analysis**
Examines regional factors that can influence local real estate values

Key Factors to analyze
* Natural: Resources, climate, topography
* Demographic: Population migration, age structure, income levels/trends, employment types
* Economic: Location of markets, transportation systems, major industries, tax levels
* Government/Political: Provincial laws, responsiveness to needs, zoning, building codes, local services, tax policy, alternative revenue sources
* Social: Racial/ethnic/religious composition, social homogeneity or diversity
###### Step 4: Data Analysis
`Latent Value`: The value possessed by a property that has potential for redevelopment because it is currently not employed at its highest and best use

**Degree of Development & Highest and Best Use Analysis**
Determines if current property use gives max net return; helps select appraisal approach

###### Step 5: Selection of the Appropriate Appraisal Approach
**Three approaches
* Direct Comparison: Based on principle of substitution; value from recent sales of similar properties; uses sales data, listings, offers.
* Income (Investment): Value = present value of anticipated future net benefits; used mainly for income- producing properties; compares rents & expenses to sale price
* Cost: Estimates value based on land + cost to replace/ improve - depreciation

**Residual Method**
* For properties with redevelopment and potential / latent value
* Combines elements of direct comparison, income, and cost approaches
* Steps:
	* Estimate market value on completion of proposed development
	* Deduct all development costs
	* Resulting residual value = land's market value at highest & best use

###### Step 6: Reconciliation & Final Opinion of Value
Arrive at the final value conclusion after applying chosen approaches

Process:
* Evaluate strengths/weaknesses of each approach's result.
* Justify why one value is most reliable

###### Step 7: Communicate Findings
Present analysis & value conclusion to client

#### Comparative Market Analysis
* Estimate market value & suggesting listing or offer price
* Short-form direct comparison using 3-5 recent, similar sales + listings
*
