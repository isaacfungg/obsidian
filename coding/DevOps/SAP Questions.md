#### Data Structures and Algorithm
How does stack, queue and other data structures work?
* Stack: LIFO
* Queue: FIFO
Difference between tuple and list?
* Tuples are immutable
* Lists are mutable
Types of linked lists
- **Singly Linked List:** Each node points to the next node in the sequence, ending with a null to signify the end of the list.
- **Doubly Linked List:** Each node points both to the next and the previous node, allowing bidirectional traversal.
- **Circular Linked List:** Similar to singly or doubly linked lists, but the last node points back to the first node, forming a loop.
REST API vs SOAP
- **REST (Representational State Transfer):**
    - Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
    - Statelessness: Each request from client to server must contain all the information needed to understand and complete the request.
    - Can use various formats like JSON, XML, HTML, or plain text for data exchange.
    - Generally considered easier to use and more flexible.
    - More suited for web services and public APIs.
- **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):**  
    - Relies on XML-based message protocol for exchange of information.
    - Requires a strict message structure and can be more heavyweight than REST.
    - Can operate over HTTP, SMTP, TCP, and more, making it more versatile in terms of transport.
    - Built-in error handling and higher security features like WS-Security.
    - Often used in enterprise environments for its formal contracts (WSDL documents) and stateful operations.
