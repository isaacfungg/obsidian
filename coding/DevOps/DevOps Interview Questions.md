***
Requirements to become a DevOps Engineer:
* Excellent technical background
* Scripting and automation skills
* Cloud computing experience


How is DevOps different from agile methodology?
* DevOps allows the development and the operations team to work together. This results in continuous development, testing, integration, deployment and monitoring of the software throughout the lifecycle.


What are the different phases in DevOps?
* `Plan`: Getting a rough picture of the development process is always a good idea
* `Code`: The application is coded as per the end-user requirements
* `Build`: Build the application by integrating various codes formed in the previous steps
* `Test`: This is the most crucial step of the application development. Test the application and rebuild, if necessary
* `Integrate`: Multiple codes from different programmers are integrated into one
* `Deploy`: Code is deployed into a cloud environment for further usage
* `Operate`: Operations are performed on the code if required
* `Monitor`: Application performance is monitored.

What are some of the core benefits of DevOps?
**Technical Benefits**
* Continuous software delivery
* Less complex problems to manage
* Early detection and faster correction of defects
**Business Benefits**
* Faster delivery of features
* Stable operating environments
* Improved communication and collaboration between the teams

How will you approach a project that needs to implement DevOps?
**Stage 1**
* An assessment of the existing process and implementation for about two to three weeks to identify areas of improvement so that the team can create a road map for the implementation
**Stage 2**
* Create a proof of concept. Once it is accepted and approved, the team can start on the actual implementation and roll-out of the project plan
**Stage 3**
* The project is now ready for implementing DevOps by using version control and monitoring it step by step

What is the difference between continuous delivery and continuous deployment?
**Continuous Delivery**
* Ensures code can be safely deployed on to production
* Ensures business applications and services function as expected
* Delivers every change to a production-like environment through rigorous automated testing
**Continuous Deployment
* Every change that passes the automated tests is deployed to production automatically
* Makes software development and the release process faster and more robust
* There is no explicit approval from a developer and requires a developed culture of monitoring
*
