***
**Hosts**: Any device which sends or receive traffic
* **Clients** and **Servers**
* Clients initiate requests, Servers respond
**Server**: Computers with software installed which responds to specific requests

**IP Address**: Is the identity of each host
* 32 bits represented by four octets
* Hierarchically designed

**Network**: Is what transports traffic between hosts
* Any time two hosts are connected you have a network
* Networks can contain other networks (Sub-Networks or Subnets)
* Networks connect to other networks - Internet

**Repeaters**: Regenerate signals - Allows communication across greater distances

**Hub**: Multi-port repeaters
* Facilitates scaling communication between additional hosts
* Everyone receives everyone's data

**Bridge**: Sit between Hub-connected hosts
* Bridges only have two ports
* Bridges learn which hosts are on each side

**Switch**: Combination of Hubs and Bridges - Facilitates communication within a network
* Multiple Ports
* Learns which hosts are on each port

**Router**: Facilitate communication between networks
* Provides traffic control point security, filtering, redirecting
* Have IP addresses in the Networks they are attached to 
* Create a Hierarchy in Networks and the entire internet

**Routing**: The process of moving data between networks
**Switching**: The process of moving data within networks
