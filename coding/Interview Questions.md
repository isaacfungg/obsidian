***
What is the difference between a list, set and tuple. Discuss tradeoffs
* List: Ordered collection, allows duplicates, mutable
* Set: Unordered collection, no duplicates, mutable, but elements must be immutable
* Tuple: Ordered collection, allows duplicates, immutable
Trade-offs
* List: Flexibility in modification but slower for searching elements and takes more memory
* Set: Fast for checking membership and eliminating duplicates but cannot have mutable items
* Tuple: Faster than lists for access, less memory use, but cannot be modified after creation
