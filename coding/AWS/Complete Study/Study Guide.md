#### Key Concepts
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing
* Common resources are for compute, storage, database, networking

#### Shared Responsibility Model
Examples of what AWS is responsible for:
* Hardware/Global infrastructure
* Software for Compute, Storage, Database, Networking services

Examples of what the customer is responsible for:
* Securing data via client/server-side encryption
* Configuration of Virtual Infrastructure and systems
* Configuration of managed services or 3rd party software

#### Benefits of using the cloud
**Agility** - Increase agility of business
**Pay as you go pricing** - Trade capital expenses for operating expenses
**Economy of scale** - Benefit from massive economies of scale
**Global reach** - Go global in minutes
**Security** - Shared Responsibility model
**Reliability** -Performs how you need it
**Availability** - Accessible when needed
**Scalability** Grows with demand
**Elasticity** - Quickly add or remove resources

#### Six advantages to using AWS
1. Trade capital expense for variable expense
* There are no upfront costs to using resources, and you only pay for what you use
2. Benefit from massive economies of scale
* You share costs of the resources AWS provided with millions of other customers
3. Stop guessing capacity
4. Increase speed and agility
7. Stop spending money on data centers
8. Go global in minutes

#### AWS Global Infrastructure
`Regions` - A geographical location comprised of data center clusters
`Availability zones` - One or more physical data centers within a region that have their own power networking, and connectivity to each other within a region
`Edge locations` - A site used to cache copies of data for faster delivery to end users. Mostly used for the CloudFront service

#### AWS Well-Architected Framework
**Operational Excellence** - Run and monitor systems
**Security** - Protect data and systems, mitigate risk
**Reliability** - Mitigate and recover from disruptions
**Performance Efficiency** - Use resources effectively
**Cost optimization** - Get the lowest prices

#### Managing AWS resources
`Management console` - User friendly web based interface
* The most user-friendly way to interact with and manage AWS Resources
`Software Development Kits (SDKs)` - Make your code compatible to run and manage AWS resources
* Set of tools used to build software
`Command Line Interface (CLI)` - Used to programmatically make changes to your AWS resources
* Tool you can use to create and run scripts to automate processes in AWS

#### Access Keys
2 components to access keys:
* Access Key ID
* Secret access key
