#### AWS Pricing Concepts
###### How AWS Pricing works
`Pay for what you use`: Pay exactly the amount of resources that you actually use
`Pay less when you reserve`: Some services offer reservation options that provide a significant discount compared to On-Demand Instance pricing
`Pay less with volume-based discounts when you use more`: Some services offer tiered pricing, so the per-unit cost is incrementally lower with increased usage
