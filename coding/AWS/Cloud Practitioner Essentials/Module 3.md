`Selecting a Region`
* When determining the right Region for your services, data, and applications, consider the following four business factors
* `Compliance with data governance and legal requirements`
	* For example, if your company requires all of its data to reside within the boundaries of the UK, you would choose the London Region
* `Proximity to your customers`
	* Selecting a Region that is close to your customers will help you to get content to them faster
* `Available services within a Region`
	* Sometimes the closest Region might not have all the features that you want to offer to customers
* `Pricing`
