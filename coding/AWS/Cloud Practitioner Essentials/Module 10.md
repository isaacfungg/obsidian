* Based on six pillars
	* Operational Excellence
	* Security
	* Reliability
	* Performance efficiency
	* Cost optimization
	* Sustainability

`Operational Excellence`
* Ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures
* Performing operations as code
* Annotating documentation
* Anticipating failure
* Frequently making small, reversible changes

`Security`
* Ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies
* Automate security best practices when possible
* Apply security at all layers
* Protect data in transit and at rest

`Reliability`
* Ability of a system to do the following:
	* Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions
	* Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
	* Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues
* Reliability includes testing recovery procedures, scaling horizontally to increase aggregate system availability, and automated recovering from failure.
