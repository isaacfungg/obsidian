#### The AWS Well-Architected Framework
* Helps you understand how to design and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the AWS Cloud
* Based on six pillars
	* Operational Excellence
	* Security
	* Reliability
	* Performance efficiency
	* Cost optimization
	* Sustainability

`Operational Excellence`
* Ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures
* Performing operations as code
* Annotating documentation
* Anticipating failure
* Frequently making small, reversible changes

`Security`
* Ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies
* Automate security best practices when possible
* Apply security at all layers
* Protect data in transit and at rest

`Reliability`
* Ability of a system to do the following:
	* Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions
	* Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
	* Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues
* Reliability includes testing recovery procedures, scaling horizontally to increase aggregate system availability, and automated recovering from failure.

`Performance Efficiency`
* Ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve
* Experimenting more often
* Using serverless architectures
* Designing systems to be able to go global in minutes

`Cost Optimization`
* Ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point
* Adopting a consumption model
* Analyzing and attributing expenditure
* Using managed services to reduce the cost of ownership

`Sustainability`
* Ability to improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required
* Understand your impact
* Maximize utilization

#### Benefits of AWS Cloud
###### Advantages of cloud computing
`Trade upfront expense for variable expense`
* Upfront expenses include data centers, physical servers, and other resources that you would need to invest in before using computing resources
* You can pay only when you consume computing resources with cloud computing

`Benefits from massive economies of scale`
* You can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own
* Providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale
* Translate into lower pay-as-you-go prices

`Stop guessing capacity`
* You don't have to predict how much infrastructure capacity you will need before deploying an application

`Increase speed and agility`
* Flexibility of cloud computing makes it easier for you to develop and deploy applications

`Stop spending money running and maintaing data centers`
* Cloud computing is the ability to focus less on these tasks and more on your applications and customers

`Go global in minutes`
* Enables you to quickly deploy applications to customers around the world, while providing them with low latency
