* Insured Mortgage: Loan > 80% LTV; insured by CMHC or private insurers

**By Priority or Rank
* First Mortgage

	* Has priority over all other in foreclosure
* Second/Third (junior) Mortgages
	* Higher risk, so they usually have higher interest rates and shorter terms
	* Often used to top up borrowing when the first mortgage doesn't cover the full amount

#### Mortgage Life Insurance
Definition: Insurance that pays off the remaining mortgage balance if the borrower dies while the policy is in effect
Purpose: Protects the borrower's family, not the lender. It ensures the mortgage is fully paid so the family keeps the home without needing to take over the payments

**Who can sell it**
* Mortgage brokers can sell it without being licensed insurance agents if they follow certain rules under the Insurance Licensing Exemptions Regulation
* Conditions are:
	* Must inform the borrower that buying the insurance is optional
	* Must state that they are not a licensed insurance agent
	* Must disclose whether it's a group policy and who holds it
	* Must explain basic terms and conditions, including how to make a claim

#### Mortgage Repayment Plans
`Face Value`: The total loan amount stated in the mortgage
`Book Value`: The outstanding balance of the mortgage at any point in time

**Loan Amount vs Funds Received**
* Borrowers may receive less than the face value because some costs are deducted
* Borrowers often choose to borrow slightly more to cover these costs upfront and preserve cash for down payment or moving expenses.

#### Types of Mortgage Repayment Plans
**Interest-Accruing Loan
* No payments during the term
* Interest accumulates and is paid with principal at maturity

**Interest-Only Plan**
* Borrower pays only interest during the term
* No principal is repaid until maturity
* Risk: Borrower owes full loan amount at the end

**Straight-Line Principal Reduction Plan
* Borrower repays equal principal amounts each period plus interest on the remaining balance
* Payments start high and decrease over time as interest drops

**Constant Payment Mortgage
* Most common in residential lending
* Borrower pays the same amount each period
* Each payment includes interest and principal
* Over time, the interest portion decreases, and the principal portion increases
	* This is because interest is charged on the remaining loan balance

**Increased Amortization Period
* An increased amortization period means stretching out the time over which the mortgage is paid off
* This lowers monthly payments but you end up paying more total interest

**Partially Amortized Mortgage
* Payments are based on long amortization but the term is shorter
* At term-end there's a balloon payment - the remaining balance must be paid or refinanced
* Protects lenders from long-term interest rate risk

**Variable rate Mortgage 
* Interest rate can change during the term (based on market rates), usually tied to the lender's prime rate
* Monthly payments may stay the same, but the amount going toward principal vs interest varies
* Borrowers accept the risk of an increase in interest in exchange for usually lower starting rates

**Balloon and Outstanding Balance
* When a mortgage is not fully paid off by the end of its term, the outstanding balance remaining is called a balloon payment
* This occurs when the loan is not fully amortized over the term
* The borrower must repay or refinance the remaining principal when the term ends

#### Innovative Options for Constant Payment Mortgages
Borrowers often want to reduce how long they're in debt. Reducing the amortization period saves a significant amount in interest but increases each payment, which may be unaffordable.

**Increased Mortgage Payments/Principal Prepayments
* Borrowers can pay extra through larger regular payments or lump sums
* This reduces the outstanding balance, lowers total interest costs, and shortens amortization
* Lenders usually set a prepayment limit

**Increased Payment Frequency
* Instead of monthly payments, borrowers can choose bi-weekly or weekly schedules.
* More frequent payments reduce the time interest accrues between payments helping to pay off the mortgage faster
* Total annual payments remain about the same, but the amortization period shortens, and interest costs decrease

**Accelerated Payments
* Accelerated payment plans involve paying slightly more per period than standard plans
* Instead of dividing the monthly plan exactly, lenders base the bi-weekly amount on half of what would be 14 monthly payments
* This is automated by the lender whereas *increased mortgage payments* are manual

#### Alternative Mortgage Repayment Plans
**Graduated Payment Mortgage
* Payments start low and increase gradually over time
* Designed for borrowers expecting future income growth
* Designed for borrowers expecting future income growth

**Combination Mortgage (Hybrid)
* Combines features of two or more types of loans

**Open vs Closed Mortgages
* Open mortgages allow the borrower to repay all or part of the loan at any time without penalty
	* Typically come with higher interest rates due to flexibility
* Closed mortgages restrict prepayment, often only allowing small annual lump sum payments without penalty
	* Offer lower interest rates than open mortgages
