`Fundamental Analyst`: Make decisions based on their assessment of value, through an analysis of a number of factors such as financial statements, economic conditions, and an understanding of supply/demand factors
`Technical Traders`: Make decisions based on information contained in past price changes themselves

It is recommended to focus of three-day to two-week swings since larger institutions are not able to make those trades.

Simplicity is often better than complexity

Price bars should be the first and most important thing your eye is drawn to

One exception to the principle of keeping charts consistent might be in the case of very long-term charts spanning multiple years, or shorter term charts in which an asset has greatly increase in value (by over 100 percent). In these cases, the vertical axis of the chart should be scaled logarithmically.

Multiple time frames can provide context for and inform patterns on a single time frame.
They should be related to each other by a factor of 3 to 5

`Motive force`: Attempts to move price to be the result of two interacting forces
`Resistive Force`: That opposes motive force
`Market Structure`: Static structure visible on charts, made up of previous movements in the market and places where those movements stopped
`Price Action`: The dynamic process that creates market structure
`Pivot high`: A bar that has a higher high than the bar that came before it and the bar that comes after it
`Second-Order High Pivot`: A pivot point that is higher than the pivots that precede and follow it.

In practice, most of our focus is on third-order pivots, which usually mark major inflections.
They offer fantastic explanations of past market action, but have little or no predictive power at the right edge. (Low pivot = downward trends)
